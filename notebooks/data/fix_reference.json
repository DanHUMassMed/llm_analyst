A specific metabolite, S-\nadenosylmethionine (SAM), influences how these genes are activated in a variety of stress\nconditions. SAM is produced by the 1-carbon cycle and is the major donor for methyla-\ntion reactions. Thus, SAM is used in the modification of histones, DNA, RNA and pro-\nduction of phospholipids. Here, we show that C. elegans with low SAM have reduced\nresponses to a bacterial and toxic stress, but respond normally to heat stress. We also ana-\nlyzed how animals that have reduced activity in some of the enzymes that use SAM to\nmodify histones might respond to stress. One enzyme, SET-2, was needed only for sur-\nvival in bacterial stress, whereas the other related enzyme, SET-16, was universally\nrequired. The availability of SAM may be affected by diets low in choline or methionine,\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007812\n\nSource: PLOSGen-Stress-responsive_and_metabolic_gene_regulation_are_altered_in_low_S-adenosylmethionine.pdf\nTitle: \nContent: found that dietary limitation of methyl donors markedly decreases the time for development of\nliver injury [39, 40], thus, we suggest that low SAM could exacerbate disease progressing by lim-\niting the ability of a tissue to respond to additional stress. This could increase the severity or the\nprogression of a disease by limiting cellular defensive responses. Finally, other metabolites such\nas Acetyl CoA and NAD+ also influence gene regulation [3]. By having multiple metabolic\npathways influencing histone modification and gene regulation, cells might finely tune tran-\nscription to diverse nutritional signals providing templates for specific metabolic states.\nMaterials and methods\nC. elegans culture, RNAi and stress applications\nC. elegans (N2) were cultured using standard laboratory conditions on E. coli OP50.

Another \nmetabolite that can affect a broad array of mechanisms is s-adenosylmethionine (SAM). \nProduced by the 1-carbon cycle (1CC), SAM is the donor for methylation of histones and \nother proteins, nucleic acids, and is used in phospholipid synthesis (Kaelin and McKnight, \n2013; Mato et al., 2008; Vance, 2014) (Figure 1A, see also Table S1 for human orthologs). \nReduced 1CC function is strongly associated with metabolic disorders, particularly fatty \nliver disease, which is characterized by lipid accumulation and immune dysfunction (Lu et \nal., 2001).

A specific metabolite, S-\nadenosylmethionine (SAM), influences how these genes are activated in a variety of stress\nconditions. SAM is produced by the 1-carbon cycle and is the major donor for methyla-\ntion reactions. Thus, SAM is used in the modification of histones, DNA, RNA and pro-\nduction of phospholipids.

SAM is a key player in the 1-carbon cycle, which links essential nutrients like methionine, folate, and vitamin B12 to the production of nucleotides, glutathione, and SAM itself ([elife-S-adenosylmethionine_synthases_specify_distinct_H3K4me3_populations.pdf](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2021.09.022)).\n\n### SAM and Phosphatidylcholine Production\n\nSAM is essential for the production of phosphatidylcholine (PC), a key phospholipid involved in cell membrane structure and function. The availability of SAM influences hepatic PC synthesis, which in turn affects lipid metabolism and storage ([EndocMetab-1-carbon_cycle_metabolites_methylate_their_way_to_fatty_liver.pdf](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2021.09.022)). Alterations in SAM levels can impact the balance between PC production and other metabolic pathways, leading to lipid accumulation in the liver ([EndocMetab-1-carbon_cycle_metabolites_methylate_their_way_to_fatty_liver.pdf](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2021.09.022)).\n\n### SAM, Stress-Responsive Gene Expression, and Fatty Liver Disease\n\nLow SAM levels have been associated with altered stress-responsive gene regulation, which can contribute to the development of fatty liver disease ([PLOSGen-Stress-responsive_and_metabolic_gene_regulation_are_altered_in_low_S-adenosylmethionine.pdf](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007812)). SAM deficiency may impact the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism and stress responses, leading to dysregulation of hepatic lipid homeostasis ([CellMetab-s-adenosylmethionine_levels_govern_innate_immunity.pdf](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2015.07.013)).\n\n### Link Between SAM, PC, and Fatty Liver Pathology\n\nStudies have shown that low levels of 1-carbon cycle metabolites, including SAM and PC, accompany lipid accumulation in various models of fatty liver disease ([EndocMetab-1-carbon_cycle_metabolites_methylate_their_way_to_fatty_liver.pdf](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2021.09.022)). The dysregulation of SAM-dependent DNA or histone methylation pathways can influence gene expression patterns associated with hepatic lipid accumulation ([EndocMetab-1-carbon_cycle_metabolites_methylate_their_way_to_fatty_liver.pdf](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2021.09.022)).\n\n### Implications for Therapeutic Interventions\n\nUnderstanding the intricate relationship between SAM, lipid metabolism, and fatty liver disease opens up avenues for potential therapeutic interventions. Targeting pathways involved in SAM production and utilization, as well as PC synthesis, could offer new strategies for managing and treating conditions related to hepatic lipid accumulation ([EndocMetab-1-carbon_cycle_metabolites_methylate_their_way_to_fatty_liver.pdf](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2021.09.022)).\n\nBy delving into the intricate interplay between SAM, lipid metabolism, and stress-responsive gene expression, researchers can gain valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying fatty liver disease and potentially identify novel therapeutic targets for intervention.\n\n\n## Impact of S-adenosylmethionine Levels on Stress-Responsive Gene Regulation\n\n### Role of S-adenosylmethionine in Gene Expression Regulation\n\nS-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is a crucial methyl donor involved in various cellular processes, including histone and DNA methylation, nucleic acid modification, and phospholipid synthesis ([Cell Metabolism](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2015.07.013)). SAM is synthesized through the 1-carbon cycle (1CC) and plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression in response to stress and metabolic changes.\n\n### Link Between SAM Levels and Stress-Responsive Gene Expression\n\nLow levels of SAM have been associated with altered stress-responsive gene regulation in various organisms. Studies have shown that reduced SAM levels can lead to deficiencies in stress-induced gene expression, impacting the ability of cells to mount effective responses to environmental challenges ([PLOS Genetics](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007812)). In Caenorhabditis elegans, decreased SAM levels resulted in compromised responses to bacterial and toxic stress, highlighting the importance of SAM in stress adaptation ([PLOS Genetics](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007812)).\n\n### Molecular Mechanisms of SAM in Gene Regulation\n\nSAM governs innate immunity through distinct methylation-dependent pathways, influencing the transcriptional response to stressors. The availability of SAM is essential for the activation of protective genes during stress conditions, underscoring its role in orchestrating cellular responses to external stimuli ([Cell Metabolism](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2015.07.013)).\n\n### Impact of SAM Deficiency on Lipid Metabolism and Stress Response\n\nSAM deficiency has been linked to metabolic disorders, particularly fatty liver disease, characterized by lipid accumulation and immune dysfunction ([Cell Metabolism](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2015.07.013)). Low SAM levels can impair lipid metabolism pathways, affecting the synthesis of phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine (PC), which are essential for membrane structure and function.\n\n### SAM-Mediated Regulation of Lipid Metabolism and Stress-Responsive Genes\n\nSAM levels play a critical role in governing lipid metabolism and stress-responsive gene expression. The interplay between SAM availability, PC synthesis, and gene regulation highlights the intricate connections between metabolic pathways and cellular responses to environmental cues ([PLOS Genetics](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007812)). Understanding the impact of SAM on lipid metabolism and stress-responsive gene expression provides insights into potential therapeutic targets for metabolic disorders and stress-related conditions.\n\n---\nBy focusing on the impact of S-adenosylmethionine levels on stress-responsive gene regulation, this report delves into the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying the interplay between SAM metabolism, lipid metabolism, and cellular stress responses.\n\n\n### Interplay between One-Carbon Cycle Metabolites, Phosphatidylcholine, and Lipid Metabolism\n\n#### One-Carbon Cycle Metabolites and S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM)\nThe one-carbon cycle plays a crucial role in providing methyl groups for various cellular processes, including DNA methylation, histone modification, and phospholipid synthesis. S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is a central molecule in one-carbon metabolism, serving as the primary methyl donor for methylation reactions ([Shyh-Chang et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1226603)). SAM levels are tightly regulated and have been linked to diverse cellular functions, including lipid metabolism and stress-responsive gene expression. Studies have shown that alterations in threonine metabolism can impact SAM levels and histone methylation, influencing gene expression patterns and cellular responses ([Shyh-Chang et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1226603)).\n\n#### SAM and Lipid Metabolism\nSAM not only participates in epigenetic regulation but also plays a critical role in lipid metabolism. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is a major phospholipid involved in cellular membrane structure and lipid metabolism. SAM is essential for the synthesis of PC through the methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) ([Mart\u00ednez-U\u00f1a et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1002/hep.26445)). The interplay between SAM levels and PC synthesis is crucial for maintaining cellular membrane integrity and regulating lipid homeostasis.\n\n#### Impact of SAM Levels on Lipid Homeostasis\nStudies have demonstrated that alterations in SAM levels can impact lipid homeostasis and contribute to metabolic disorders such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Excess SAM has been shown to reroute phosphatidylethanolamine towards PC and triglyceride synthesis, leading to lipid accumulation in the liver ([Mart\u00ednez-U\u00f1a et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1002/hep.26445)). Dysregulation of SAM metabolism can disrupt the balance between PC and PE levels, affecting membrane integrity and lipid metabolism.\n\n#### Role of SAM in Stress-Responsive Gene Expression\nSAM levels also play a critical role in regulating stress-responsive gene expression. Studies have highlighted the importance of SAM-dependent pathways in governing innate immunity and stress responses ([Ding et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2015.07.013)). Changes in SAM levels can impact the methylation status of histones, influencing the expression of stress-responsive genes and modulating cellular responses to environmental stimuli.\n\n#### Integration of One-Carbon Metabolism and Lipid Homeostasis\nThe integration of one-carbon metabolism, SAM levels, and lipid homeostasis underscores the intricate connections between cellular processes. The regulation of SAM-dependent pathways not only influences epigenetic modifications but also impacts lipid metabolism and stress-responsive gene expression. Understanding the interplay between these pathways is essential for unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying metabolic disorders and cellular responses to environmental cues.\n\nIn conclusion, the interplay between one-carbon cycle metabolites, SAM, phosphatidylcholine, and lipid metabolism is a complex network of interactions that govern cellular functions and responses.
