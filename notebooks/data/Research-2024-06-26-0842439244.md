# The Role of S-Adenosylmethionine in Lipid Metabolism and Stress-Responsive Gene Expression

S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is a pivotal metabolite in cellular metabolism, acting as the principal methyl donor in numerous biochemical reactions. Its synthesis and utilization are intricately linked to the one-carbon cycle (1CC), a network of pathways that integrate essential nutrients such as methionine, folate, and vitamin B12. SAM's role extends beyond simple methylation; it is crucial for the regulation of lipid metabolism and stress-responsive gene expression.

SAM is synthesized from methionine through the action of methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT). This process is tightly regulated and influenced by the availability of methionine, which can be imported from the diet or generated endogenously via the 1CC. The 1CC itself is a metabolic nexus, producing not only methionine but also nucleotides, glutathione, and other critical biomolecules ([Ducker and Rabinowitz, 2017](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.79511)).

In lipid metabolism, SAM is essential for the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC), a major component of cell membranes. PC synthesis involves the methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), a process that consumes a significant portion of cellular SAM. Disruptions in SAM levels can lead to altered PC synthesis, impacting membrane integrity and lipid homeostasis. For instance, reduced SAM levels are associated with lipid accumulation and the activation of lipogenic transcription factors such as SREBP-1 ([Walker et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2011.09.045)).

Moreover, SAM plays a critical role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression through the methylation of histones and DNA. This methylation is crucial for the activation or repression of genes involved in stress responses. Studies in *Caenorhabditis elegans* have shown that low SAM levels impair the expression of stress-responsive genes, affecting the organism's ability to cope with bacterial and toxic stress ([Ding et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007812)). Interestingly, different SAM synthase enzymes exhibit specificity towards target sequences, adding a layer of control over histone methylation and gene expression patterns during stress ([Godbole et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.79511)).

The interplay between SAM, lipid metabolism, and gene expression highlights the metabolite's central role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Understanding these connections is crucial for developing therapeutic strategies for metabolic disorders and stress-related diseases. This report delves into the biochemical pathways involving SAM, elucidating its impact on lipid metabolism and stress-responsive gene expression.

## S-adenosylmethionine and its Role in Lipid Metabolism

### S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) Production and Function

S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is a critical metabolite produced by the 1-carbon cycle (1CC), which involves the conversion of methionine to SAM. This process is essential for various methylation reactions, including those involving histones, nucleic acids, and phospholipids ([Kaelin & McKnight, 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2015.07.013)). SAM serves as the primary methyl donor in these reactions, thereby playing a pivotal role in regulating gene expression and cellular function.

### SAM and Phosphatidylcholine (PC) Synthesis

One of the primary roles of SAM in lipid metabolism is its involvement in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC), a major component of cell membranes. In liver cells, up to 40% of SAM is utilized for PC production through the methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) ([Vance, 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2015.07.013)). This process is crucial for maintaining membrane integrity and function. The Kennedy pathway also contributes to PC synthesis independently of the 1CC, but the PC species generated through methylation differ in their side chains from those produced by the Kennedy pathway ([Walker, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2015.07.013)).

### SAM Deficiency and Lipid Accumulation

Reduced levels of SAM are strongly associated with metabolic disorders, particularly fatty liver disease, which is characterized by lipid accumulation and immune dysfunction ([Lu et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2015.07.013)). SAM deficiency can lead to a decrease in PC levels, which in turn activates the lipogenic transcription factor SREBP-1, promoting lipid accumulation ([Ding et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2015.07.013)). This mechanism is evident in various models, including invertebrates, rodents, and humans, where low levels of 1CC metabolites or PC accompany lipid accumulation in the liver ([Walker, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2015.07.013)).

### Molecular Mechanisms Linking SAM to Lipid Metabolism

The molecular mechanisms by which SAM influences lipid metabolism are multifaceted. SAM-dependent DNA and histone methylation can affect gene expression, thereby influencing metabolic pathways. For instance, mutations or drugs affecting key enzymes in the 1CC result in hepatosteatosis, highlighting the critical role of this cycle in liver function ([Walker, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2015.07.013)). Additionally, specific PC isoforms are required for the activation of nuclear hormone receptors such as LRH-1, which drives bile acid export from the liver, further linking SAM to lipid metabolism ([Walker, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2015.07.013)).

### SAM and Stress-Responsive Gene Expression

SAM also plays a significant role in stress-responsive gene expression. In Caenorhabditis elegans, reduced SAM levels lead to deficiencies in H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) at pathogen-response genes, decreasing their expression and limiting pathogen resistance ([Ding et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007812)). This suggests that SAM is generally required for stress-responsive transcription. Genetic assays have shown that transcriptional responses to bacterial or xenotoxic stress fail in C. elegans with low SAM, while heat shock gene expression remains unaffected ([Ding et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007812)).

### Differential Roles of SAM Synthases

The specificity of SAM synthase enzymes in targeting sequences for methylation adds another layer of regulation. For example, the loss of two SAM synthases (sams-1 and sams-4) differentially impacts stress response phenotypes, histone methylation, and gene expression profiles ([Godbole et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.79511)). This indicates that the regulatory functions of SAM depend on its enzymatic source, and provisioning of SAM may be an important regulatory step linking 1CC function to phenotypes in aging and stress ([Godbole et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.79511)).

### Implications for Human Health

The implications of SAM metabolism for human health are profound. Disruptions in the 1CC or PC synthesis are linked to various diseases, including alcoholism, congenital lipodystrophy, and cystic fibrosis, which often present with fatty liver ([Walker, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2015.07.013)). Understanding how individual metabolites drive mechanisms increasing stored hepatic lipids is critical for developing therapeutic strategies. For instance, betaine, a 1CC metabolite that can serve as a source for SAM, has been shown to reduce fatty liver in mice ([Walker, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2015.07.013)).

### Conclusion

In summary, SAM is a pivotal metabolite linking the 1-carbon cycle to lipid metabolism and stress-responsive gene expression. Its role in PC synthesis, gene methylation, and stress response underscores its importance in maintaining cellular function and metabolic health. Further research into the specific mechanisms by which SAM influences these processes will be essential for developing targeted therapies for metabolic disorders and stress-related diseases.


## Impact of S-adenosylmethionine on Stress-Responsive Gene Expression

### Role of S-adenosylmethionine in Methylation and Gene Regulation

S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is a crucial methyl donor involved in the methylation of histones, nucleic acids, and phospholipids. This methylation process is essential for the regulation of gene expression, particularly under stress conditions. SAM is synthesized from methionine through the 1-carbon cycle (1CC), which also involves nutrients such as folate and vitamin B12 ([Godbole et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.79511)). The availability of SAM directly influences the methylation status of histones, which in turn affects chromatin structure and gene expression.

In a study by [Ding et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007812), it was demonstrated that Caenorhabditis elegans with reduced SAM levels exhibited altered stress-responsive gene regulation. Specifically, these worms showed deficiencies in responding to bacterial and toxic stress, although their response to heat stress remained unaffected. This suggests that SAM plays a selective role in modulating gene expression in response to different types of stress.

### Differential Impact of SAM Synthase Enzymes

The specificity of SAM synthase enzymes towards target sequences adds another layer of control over gene expression. According to [Godbole et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.79511), the loss of SAM synthase enzymes (sams-1 and sams-4) differentially impacts stress response phenotypes, histone methylation, and gene expression profiles. This differential impact suggests that enzyme provisioning can select specific targets for epigenetic modification, thereby influencing the organism's ability to respond to stress.

### SAM and Lipid Metabolism

SAM is not only involved in gene regulation but also plays a significant role in lipid metabolism. It is a key component in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC), a methylated phospholipid. Reduced SAM levels can lead to decreased PC synthesis, which in turn activates the transcription factor SBP-1/SREBP-1, leading to lipid accumulation ([Cell Metab., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2015.07.013)). This lipid accumulation is often associated with metabolic disorders such as fatty liver disease, characterized by immune dysfunction and tissue injury.

In the context of stress, SAM deficiency has been linked to altered lipid metabolism, which can exacerbate stress responses. For instance, in alcohol-induced fatty liver disease (ALD), nutritional limitation of 1CC function accelerates liver injury, highlighting the interplay between SAM levels, lipid metabolism, and stress responses ([Halsted et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2015.07.013)).

### Stress-Responsive Gene Expression in Low SAM Conditions

The impact of low SAM on stress-responsive gene expression is multifaceted. In C. elegans, low SAM levels result in reduced responses to bacterial and toxic stress but normal responses to heat stress ([Ding et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007812)). This differential response is partly due to the role of specific histone-modifying enzymes. For example, the enzyme SET-2 is required for survival during bacterial stress, whereas SET-16 is universally required for stress responses.

Moreover, RNA sequencing data from SAM-deficient worms revealed significant changes in the expression of genes involved in immune regulation and lipid metabolism ([GEO accession numbers GSE121511, GSE121509, GSE121510](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/)). These findings underscore the importance of SAM in coordinating metabolic and immune responses under stress conditions.

### Mechanisms of SAM in Epigenetic Regulation

SAM's role in epigenetic regulation is primarily mediated through its function as a methyl donor. Methylation of histones, particularly H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), is a key epigenetic mark associated with active gene transcription. The specificity of SAM synthase enzymes towards different histone targets can influence the distribution of H3K4me3 marks, thereby modulating gene expression patterns during stress ([Godbole et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.79511)).

For instance, the loss of sams-1 and sams-4 enzymes results in distinct H3K4me3 populations, which correlate with different gene expression profiles under heat stress. This suggests that SAM synthase enzymes can selectively target specific genes for methylation, thereby fine-tuning the organism's stress response.

### Nutritional Influence on SAM Levels and Stress Responses

Dietary intake of nutrients such as choline and methionine can significantly influence SAM levels and, consequently, stress-responsive gene expression. Diets low in these nutrients can reduce SAM availability, leading to impaired methylation processes and altered stress responses ([PLOS Genetics, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007812)). This nutritional regulation of SAM levels highlights the importance of diet in maintaining optimal stress responses and metabolic health.

In summary, SAM plays a critical role in linking metabolism and stress-responsive gene expression through its function as a methyl donor. The availability of SAM, influenced by dietary intake and the activity of specific SAM synthase enzymes, can modulate gene expression patterns and lipid metabolism, thereby affecting the organism's ability to respond to stress. Understanding these mechanisms provides valuable insights into the interplay between metabolism, epigenetics, and stress responses.


## Interconnection between S-adenosylmethionine, Lipid Metabolism, and Stress Responses

### S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and Lipid Metabolism

S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is a critical metabolite produced by the 1-carbon cycle (1CC), which serves as the primary methyl donor for numerous methylation reactions, including those involving histones, nucleic acids, and phospholipids ([CellMetab](https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(15)00304-4)). SAM's role in lipid metabolism is particularly significant in the liver, where it is involved in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC), a major component of cell membranes and lipoproteins.

#### Phosphatidylcholine Synthesis

Phosphatidylcholine can be synthesized via two main pathways: the Kennedy pathway and the methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). In the liver, up to 40% of SAM is utilized for the methylation of PE to produce PC ([EndocMetab](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5739282/)). This process is crucial for maintaining lipid homeostasis and preventing hepatic steatosis, a condition characterized by excessive lipid accumulation in the liver.

#### SAM and Hepatic Lipogenesis

Low levels of SAM are strongly associated with lipid accumulation in the liver, a hallmark of fatty liver disease. This condition can arise from various metabolic disorders, including alcohol-induced fatty liver disease (ALD) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) ([CellMetab](https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(15)00304-4)). SAM deficiency impairs the synthesis of PC, leading to disrupted lipid metabolism and increased lipogenesis. Additionally, SAM-dependent methylation of DNA and histones can influence the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism, further contributing to hepatic lipid accumulation ([EndocMetab](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5739282/)).

### SAM and Stress Responses

SAM plays a pivotal role in the regulation of stress-responsive gene expression through its involvement in methylation reactions. These modifications can alter chromatin structure and gene expression patterns, enabling cells to adapt to various stress conditions.

#### Histone and DNA Methylation

SAM-dependent methylation of histones and DNA is a key mechanism by which cells regulate gene expression in response to stress. For instance, the trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) is a well-known marker of active transcription and is influenced by SAM levels ([eLife](https://elifesciences.org/articles/79511)). Studies in *Caenorhabditis elegans* have shown that different SAM synthases (e.g., SAMS-1 and SAMS-4) contribute differently to H3K4me3 modification and stress responses. Loss of SAMS-1 or SAMS-4 differentially impacts stress response phenotypes, histone methylation, and gene expression profiles, suggesting that the regulatory functions of SAM depend on its enzymatic source ([eLife](https://elifesciences.org/articles/79511)).

#### Gene Expression and Survival

Reduced SAM levels have been linked to altered stress-responsive and metabolic gene regulation. In *C. elegans*, low SAM levels result in diminished responses to bacterial and toxic stress, although responses to heat stress remain unaffected ([PLOSGen](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1007812)). This differential response highlights the complexity of SAM's role in stress adaptation. Additionally, specific histone methyltransferases, such as SET-2 and SET-16, are required for survival under certain stress conditions, further emphasizing the importance of SAM-dependent methylation in stress responses ([PLOSGen](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1007812)).

### SAM, Lipid Metabolism, and Immune Function

The interplay between SAM, lipid metabolism, and immune function is particularly evident in the context of fatty liver disease. Low SAM levels are associated with immune dysfunction and increased susceptibility to infections, which can exacerbate liver pathology.

#### Immune Dysfunction in Fatty Liver Disease

Fatty liver disease is often accompanied by immune dysfunction, characterized by altered cytokine production and impaired immune cell function. SAM deficiency can contribute to this dysfunction by affecting the methylation of genes involved in immune responses. For example, SAM-dependent DNA methylation can influence the expression of cytokines and other immune-related genes, thereby modulating immune responses ([CellMetab](https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(15)00304-4)).

#### SAM and Innate Immunity

SAM levels govern innate immunity through distinct methylation-dependent pathways. Fluctuations in SAM levels can impact hepatic PC synthesis and DNA or histone methylation, leading to variations in immune responses. Low SAM levels are associated with increased lipid accumulation, tissue injury, and altered immune responses in fatty liver disease ([CellMetab](https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(15)00304-4)). This suggests that maintaining adequate SAM levels is crucial for both lipid metabolism and immune function.

### Molecular Mechanisms Linking SAM to Lipid Metabolism and Stress Responses

Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which SAM influences lipid metabolism and stress responses is critical for developing therapeutic strategies for metabolic disorders and stress-related diseases.

#### Methylation-Dependent Regulation

SAM-dependent methylation of histones and DNA plays a central role in regulating gene expression in response to metabolic and stress signals. For instance, the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) is associated with active transcription and is influenced by SAM levels. Changes in H3K4me3 levels can alter the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism and stress responses, thereby linking SAM metabolism to these processes ([eLife](https://elifesciences.org/articles/79511)).

#### Phosphatidylcholine and Lipid Signaling

Phosphatidylcholine (PC) produced via SAM-dependent methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) plays a crucial role in lipid signaling and intracellular transport. Low PC levels can affect signaling pathways that control lipid metabolism, such as the activation of the lipogenic transcription factor SREBP-1. Additionally, specific PC isoforms are required for the activation of nuclear hormone receptors like LRH-1, which drive bile acid export from the liver ([EndocMetab](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5739282/)).

#### SAM and Epigenetic Regulation

SAM's role in epigenetic regulation extends beyond histone and DNA methylation. It also includes the methylation of RNA and other proteins, which can influence gene expression and cellular responses to stress. For example, SAM-dependent RNA methylation can affect mRNA stability and translation, thereby modulating the expression of stress-responsive genes ([PLOSGen](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1007812)).

### Therapeutic Implications

Given the critical role of SAM in lipid metabolism and stress responses, therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating SAM levels or its downstream effects could be beneficial for treating metabolic disorders and enhancing stress resilience.

#### SAM Supplementation

SAM supplementation has been explored as a potential therapeutic approach for various liver diseases, including ALD and NAFLD. By restoring SAM levels, it may be possible to improve PC synthesis, reduce lipid accumulation, and enhance immune function in the liver ([CellMetab](https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(15)00304-4)).

#### Targeting Methylation Pathways

Targeting specific methylation pathways influenced by SAM could provide a more precise approach to modulating gene expression and cellular responses. For example, inhibitors of specific histone methyltransferases or DNA methyltransferases could be used to alter the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism and stress responses ([eLife](https://elifesciences.org/articles/79511)).

#### Nutritional Interventions

Dietary interventions that enhance SAM production, such as increasing the intake of methionine, folate, and vitamin B12, could also be beneficial. These nutrients are essential for the 1-carbon cycle and SAM synthesis, and their adequate intake could support optimal SAM levels and metabolic health ([EndocMetab](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5739282/)).

In summary, SAM is a pivotal metabolite that links lipid metabolism and stress-responsive gene expression through its role in methylation reactions. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these connections is crucial for developing effective therapeutic strategies for metabolic and stress-related diseases.


## Metabolism of S-adenosylmethionine and Its Link to Lipid Metabolism and Stress-Responsive Gene Expression

### S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and Its Role in Methylation

S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is a critical methyl donor involved in numerous methylation reactions, including those affecting histones, DNA, RNA, and phospholipids. SAM is synthesized from methionine via the one-carbon cycle (1CC), which integrates essential nutrients such as folate and vitamin B12 ([Ducker & Rabinowitz, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2015.07.013)). The methylation reactions facilitated by SAM are crucial for regulating gene expression, particularly under stress conditions.

### SAM and Lipid Metabolism

SAM plays a significant role in lipid metabolism, particularly in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC), a methylated phospholipid. The enzyme phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to PC using SAM as a methyl donor. This process is vital for maintaining cellular membrane integrity and lipid homeostasis ([Vance, 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2015.07.013)).

#### Impact of SAM Deficiency on Lipid Metabolism

Reduced levels of SAM can lead to significant disruptions in lipid metabolism. For instance, in Caenorhabditis elegans, RNA interference (RNAi) targeting the SAM synthase gene sams-1 results in decreased PC synthesis, leading to lipid accumulation. This lipid accumulation is mediated by the activation of the transcription factor SBP-1/SREBP-1, which upregulates lipogenic genes ([Ding et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2015.07.013)). The upregulation of these genes promotes lipid biosynthesis, exacerbating lipid accumulation and potentially leading to metabolic disorders.

### SAM and Stress-Responsive Gene Expression

SAM's role extends beyond lipid metabolism to the regulation of stress-responsive gene expression. The methylation of histones and DNA by SAM is a key mechanism through which gene expression is modulated in response to stress.

#### Differential Impact of SAM Synthases on Stress Response

Research has shown that different SAM synthase enzymes, such as SAMS-1 and SAMS-4, have distinct roles in stress response. For example, in C. elegans, the loss of SAMS-1 and SAMS-4 differentially affects stress response phenotypes, histone methylation, and gene expression profiles. SAMS-4, but not SAMS-1, is essential for survival under heat stress, indicating that the source of SAM can influence the specific stress response pathways activated ([Godbole et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.79511)).

### Interaction Between SAM, Lipid Metabolism, and Stress Response

The interplay between SAM, lipid metabolism, and stress-responsive gene expression is complex and multifaceted. SAM deficiency can lead to altered lipid metabolism, which in turn can affect stress response pathways.

#### Lipid Metabolism and Stress Response

Lipid metabolism is closely linked to stress response mechanisms. For instance, the accumulation of lipids due to reduced PC synthesis can activate stress response pathways. In C. elegans, SAM deficiency leads to the upregulation of immune regulators, including components of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, which are crucial for stress response ([Ding et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007812)).

#### Epigenetic Regulation of Stress-Responsive Genes

SAM-mediated methylation of histones plays a critical role in the epigenetic regulation of stress-responsive genes. Histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) is a key epigenetic mark associated with active gene transcription. The availability of SAM influences the levels of H3K4me3, thereby affecting the expression of stress-responsive genes. In C. elegans, reduced SAM levels lead to decreased H3K4me3 at stress-responsive gene loci, resulting in impaired stress responses ([Godbole et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.79511)).

### Dietary Influence on SAM Levels and Metabolic Health

Dietary intake of nutrients such as choline and methionine significantly affects SAM levels and, consequently, lipid metabolism and stress response. Diets low in choline or methionine can reduce SAM availability, leading to disruptions in methylation reactions and metabolic homeostasis ([Ding et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007812)).

#### Nutritional Regulation of SAM and Lipid Metabolism

Choline and methionine are precursors in the synthesis of SAM. Adequate intake of these nutrients is essential for maintaining optimal SAM levels. Inadequate dietary intake can lead to SAM deficiency, resulting in impaired PC synthesis and lipid accumulation. This can activate stress response pathways and contribute to metabolic disorders such as fatty liver disease ([Lu et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2015.07.013)).

### SAM and Innate Immunity

SAM levels also influence innate immunity through methylation-dependent pathways. In C. elegans, SAM deficiency leads to the upregulation of immune response genes, suggesting that SAM plays a role in modulating immune function. This is particularly evident under conditions of bacterial stress, where SAM-deficient animals show altered expression of genes involved in immune response ([Ding et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2015.07.013)).

#### Epigenetic Regulation of Immune Genes

The methylation of histones and DNA by SAM is a key mechanism through which immune response genes are regulated. In SAM-deficient C. elegans, there is a significant alteration in the expression of immune genes, indicating that SAM-mediated methylation is crucial for the proper regulation of immune responses. This epigenetic regulation is essential for mounting an effective defense against pathogens and other stressors ([Ding et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007812)).

### Conclusion

The metabolism of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is intricately linked to lipid metabolism and stress-responsive gene expression. SAM's role as a methyl donor is critical for the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and the regulation of gene expression through methylation of histones and DNA. SAM deficiency can lead to disruptions in lipid metabolism, resulting in lipid accumulation and activation of stress response pathways. Additionally, SAM levels influence the expression of stress-responsive and immune genes, highlighting the importance of SAM in maintaining metabolic and immune homeostasis. Understanding the complex interplay between SAM, lipid metabolism, and stress response is essential for developing strategies to mitigate metabolic disorders and enhance stress resilience.
