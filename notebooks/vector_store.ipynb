We recently reported the characterization of a novel DEG/ENaC in Caenorhabditis elegans that we named ACD-1. ACD-1 is expressed in glial amphid sheath cells. The glial ACD-1, together with the neuronal DEG/ENaC DEG-1, is necessary for acid avoidance and attraction to lysine. We report presently that knockout of acd-1 in glia exacerbates sensory deficits caused by another mutant: the hypomorphic allele of the cGMP-gated channel subunit tax-2. Furthermore, sensory deficits caused by mutations in G(i) protein odr-3 and guanylate cyclase daf-11, which regulate the activity of TAX-2/TAX-4 channels, are worsened by knockout of acd-1. We also show that sensory neurons of acd-1 tax-2(p694) double mutants fail to undergo changes in intracellular Ca(2+) when animals are exposed to low concentrations of attractant. Finally, we show that exogenous expression of TRPV1 in sensory neurons and exposure to capsaicin rescue sensory deficits of acd-1 tax-2(p694) mutants, suggesting that sensory deficits of these mutants are bypassed by increasing neuronal excitability.

We sought to assess the orthology between C. elegans and human genes to understand better the relationship between their genomes and to generate a compelling list of candidates to streamline RNAi-based screens in this model. RESULTS: We performed a meta-analysis of results from four orthology prediction programs and generated a compendium, \\\"OrthoList\\\", containing 7,663 C. elegans protein-coding genes. Various assessments indicate that OrthoList has extensive coverage with low false-positive and false-negative rates. Part of this evaluation examined the conservation of components of the receptor tyrosine kinase, Notch, Wnt, TGF-B and insulin signaling pathways, and led us to update compendia of conserved C. elegans kinases, nuclear hormone receptors, F-box proteins, and transcription factors. Comparison with two published genome-wide RNAi screens indicated that virtually all of the conserved hits would have been obtained had just the OrthoList set (38% of the genome) been targeted. We compiled Ortholist by InterPro domains and Gene Ontology annotation, making it easy to identify C. elegans orthologs of human disease genes for potential functional analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We anticipate that OrthoList will be of considerable utility to C. elegans researchers for streamlining RNAi screens, by focusing on genes with apparent human orthologs, thus reducing screening effort by 60%. Moreover, we find that OrthoList provides a useful basis for annotating orthology and reveals more C. elegans orthologs of human genes in various functional groups, such as transcription factors, than previously described.\",\n",

Here we present OrthoList 2 (OL2), a new comparative genomic analysis between <i>C. elegans</i> and humans, and the first assessment of how changes over time affect the landscape of predicted orthologs between two species. Although we find that updates to the orthology-prediction methods significantly changed the landscape of <i>C. elegans-</i>human orthologs predicted by individual programs, and, unexpectedly, reduced agreement amongst them, we also show that our meta-analysis approach &quot;buffered&quot; against changes in gene content. We show that adding results from more programs did not lead to many additions to the list, and discuss reasons to avoid assigning &quot;scores&quot; based on support by individual orthology prediction programs, the treatment of &quot;legacy&quot; genes no longer predicted by these programs, and the practical difficulties of updating due to encountering deprecated, changed, or retired gene IDs. In addition, we consider what other criteria may support claims of orthology, and alternative approaches to find potential orthologs that elude identification by these programs. Finally, we created a new web-based tool that allows for rapid searches of OL2 by gene identifiers, protein domains (InterPro and SMART), or human-disease associations (OMIM), and also includes available RNAi resources to facilitate potential translational cross-species studies.\",\n",

These are members of the degenerin/epithelial sodium channel (DEG/ENaC) family, along with, as the name suggests, vertebrate ENaCs and degenerins of the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans. By screening all 30 C. elegans DEG/ENaCs for pH dependence, we describe, for the first time, three acid-activated members, as well as three additional acid-inhibited channels. We surveyed both groups for sensitivity to amiloride and zinc; like their mammalian counterparts, their currents can be blocked, enhanced or unaffected by these modulators. Likewise, they exhibit diverse ion selectivity. Our findings underline the diversity of acid-sensitive DEG/ENaCs across species and provide a comparative resource for better understanding the molecular basis of their function. ABSTRACT: Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are members of the diverse family of degenerin/epithelial sodium channels (DEG/ENaCs). They perform a wide range of physiological roles in healthy organisms, including in gut function and synaptic transmission, but also play important roles in disease, as acidosis is a hallmark of painful inflammatory and ischaemic conditions. We performed a screen for acid-sensitivity on all 30 subunits of the C. elegans DEG/ENaC family using Two-Electrode Voltage Clamp (TEVC) in Xenopus oocytes. We found two groups of acid-sensitive DEG/ENaCs characterised by either being inhibited or activated by increasing proton concentrations. Three of these acid-sensitive C. elegans DEG/ENaCs were activated by acidic pH, making them functionally similar to the vertebrate ASICs. We also identified three new members of the acid-inhibited DEG/ENaC group, giving a total of seven additional acid-sensitive channels. We observed sensitivity to the anti-hypertensive drug amiloride as well as modulation by the trace element zinc. Acid-sensitive DEG/ENaCs were found to be expressed in both neurons and non-neuronal tissue, highlighting the likely functional diversity of these channels. Our findings provide a framework to exploit the C. elegans channels as models to study the function of these acid-sensing channels in vivo, as well as to study them as potential targets for anti-helminthic drugs.

In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, spaced training with a tap stimulus induces habituation to the tap that lasts for &gt;24 h and is dependent on glutamate transmission, postsynaptic AMPA receptors, and CREB. Here we describe a distinct, presynaptic mechanism for a shorter lasting memory for tap habituation induced by massed training. We report that a FMRFamide-related peptide (FMRF = Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH(2)), FLP-20, is critical for memory lasting 12 h following massed training, but is not required for other forms of memory. Massed training correlated with a flp-20-dependent increase in synaptobrevin tagged with green fluorescent protein in the presynaptic terminals of the PLM mechanosensory neurons that followed the timeline of the memory trace. We also demonstrated that flp-20 is required specifically in the mechanosensory neurons for memory 12 h after massed training. These findings show that within the same species and form of learning, memory is induced by distinct mechanisms to create a lasting alteration in neurotransmission that is dependent upon the temporal pattern of training: memory of spaced training results from postsynaptic changes in the interneurons of the neural circuit, whereas memory of massed training results from presynaptic changes in the mechanosensory neurons of the neural circuit.\",\n",

To provide insight into the physiological relevance of this neuropeptide diversity, we have tested more than 30 FLPs (encoded by 23 flps) for bioactivity on C. elegans pharynx. Eleven flp genes encode peptides that inhibit pharyngeal activity, while eight flp genes encode peptides that are excitatory. Three potent peptides (inhibitory, FLP-13A, APEASPFIRFamide; excitatory, FLP-17A, KSAFVRFamide; excitatory, FLP-17B, KSQYIRFamide) are encoded by flp genes, which, according to reporter gene constructs, are expressed in pharyngeal motoneurons. Thus, they may act through receptors localized on the pharyngeal muscle. The two other potent peptides, FLP-8 (excitatory AF1, KNEFIRFamide,) and FLP-11A (inhibitory, AMRNALVRFamide), appear to be expressed in extrapharyngeal neurons and are therefore likely to act either indirectly or as neurohormones. Intriguingly, a single neuron can express peptides that have potent but opposing biological activity in the pharynx. Only five flp genes encode neuropeptides that have no observable effect on the pharynx, but none of these have shown reporter gene expression in the pharyngeal nervous system. To examine the roles of multiple peptides produced from single precursors, a comparison was made between the bioactivity of different neuropeptides for five flp genes (flp-3, flp-13, flp-14, flp-17, and flp-18). For all but one gene (flp-14), the effects of peptides encoded by the same gene were similar.

By comparing these two libraries, we have identified &gt;1000 genes that define the ASE gustatory neuron class on a molecular level. This set of genes contains determinants of the differentiated state of the ASE neuron, such as a surprisingly complex repertoire of transcription factors (TFs), ion channels, neurotransmitters, and receptors, as well as seven-transmembrane receptor (7TMR)-type putative gustatory receptor genes. Through the in vivo dissection of the cis-regulatory regions of several ASE-expressed genes, we identified a small cis-regulatory motif, the \\\"ASE motif,\\\" that is required for the expression of many ASE-expressed genes. We demonstrate that the ASE motif is a binding site for the C2H2 zinc finger TF CHE-1, which is essential for the correct differentiation of the ASE gustatory neuron. Taken together, our results provide a unique view of the molecular landscape of a single neuron type and reveal an important aspect of the regulatory logic for gustatory neuron specification in C. elegans.\",\n",

As a first step toward determining their functional roles in C. elegans, we examined the cell-specific expression pattern of the flp gene family. Of the 19 flp genes examined, each gene is expressed in a distinct set of cells; these cells include interneurons, motor neurons, and sensory neurons that are involved in multiple behaviors, as well as supporting cells, muscle cells, and epidermal cells. Several flp genes show sex-specific expression patterns. Furthermore, we find that expression of two flp genes changes in response to the developmental state of the animal. Many neurons express multiple flp genes. To investigate how flp genes are regulated in different neuronal subtypes, we examined flp expression in a small, well-defined subset of neurons, the mechanosensory neurons. Mutations in the unc-86 and mec-3 genes, which are necessary for the production and differentiation of the mechanosensory neurons, result in the complete loss of flp-4, flp-8, and flp-20 expression in mechanosensory neurons. Collectively, these data indicate that members of the flp gene family are likely to influence multiple behaviors and that their regulation can be dependent on the developmental state of the organism.\",\n",

Secondly, we extend the algorithm to account for the case when there may be a limit on the computational resources that can be spent on verifying a property; i.e, if the original algorithm is not able to make a decision even after consuming the available amount of resources, we resort to a p-value based approach to make a decision.

In the present study, we examined the role of the C. elegans carboxypeptidase E orthologue EGL-21 in the processing of peptide precursors. More than 100 carboxy-terminally extended neuropeptides were detected in egl-21 mutant strains. These findings suggest that EGL-21 is a major carboxypeptidase involved in the processing of FMRFamide-like peptide (FLP) precursors and neuropeptide-like protein (NLP) precursors. The impaired peptide profile of egl-3 and egl-21 mutants is reflected in some similar phenotypes. They both share a severe widening of the intestinal lumen, locomotion defects, and retention of embryos. In addition, egl-3 animals have decreased intestinal fat content. Taken together, these results suggest that EGL-3 and EGL-21 are key enzymes for the proper processing of neuropeptides that control egg-laying, locomotion, fat storage and the nutritional status.\",\n",

Male mating is the most complex behavior exhibited by the nematode C. elegans and involves the steps of response, backing, turning, vulva location, spicule insertion, and sperm transfer. Because neuropeptides are important neural regulators of many complex animal behaviors, we explored the function of the FMRFamide-like neuropeptide (flp) gene family in regulating male copulation. We found that peptidergic signaling mediated by FMRF-amide like neuropeptides (FLPs) FLP-8, FLP-10, FLP-12, and FLP-20 is required for the sensory transduction involved in male turning behavior. flp-8, flp-10, flp-12, and flp-20 mutant males significantly increase repetition of substep(s) of turning behavior compared with wild-type males. Genes controlling neuropeptide processing and secretion in general, including egl-3, egl-21, ida-1, and unc-31, are also required for inhibiting repetitive turning behavior. Neuropeptidergic signaling adjusts the repetitiveness of turning independently of serotonergic modulation of the timing of turning. Surprisingly, the mechanosensitive touch receptor neurons are found to be part of the neural circuitry regulating male turning behavior, indicating the existence of functional dimorphisms in the nervous system with regard to sex-specific behaviors.\",\n",

This hybrid precursor state is unstable and transitions into the stable ASEL or ASER terminal end state. Although this transition is spatially stereotyped in wild-type animals, mutant analysis reveals that each cell has the potential to transition into either the ASEL or ASER stable end state. The stability and irreversibility of the terminal differentiated state is ensured by the interactions of two microRNAs (miRNAs) and their transcription factor targets in a double-negative feedback loop. Simple feedback loops are found as common motifs in many gene regulatory networks, but the loop described here is unusually complex and involves miRNAs. The interaction of miRNAs in double-negative feedback loops may not only be a means for miRNAs to regulate their own expression but may also represent a general paradigm for how terminal cell fates are selected and stabilized.\",\n",

A single peptide (AMRNALVRFainide; activity threshold 0.1 muM), encoded on flp-11, induced response type 5, a shortening of the ovijector coupled with an increase in contraction frequency.

Whereas much is known about the macroscopic mechanisms underlying cross-modal plasticity, only scant information exists about its cellular and molecular underpinnings. We found that Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes deprived of a sense of body touch exhibit various changes in behavior, associated with other unimpaired senses. We focused on one such behavioral alteration, enhanced odor sensation, and sought to reveal the neuronal and molecular mechanisms that translate mechanosensory loss into improved olfactory acuity. To this end, we analyzed in mechanosensory mutants food-dependent locomotion patterns that are associated with olfactory responses and found changes that are consistent with enhanced olfaction. The altered locomotion could be reversed in adults by optogenetic stimulation of the touch receptor (mechanosensory) neurons. Furthermore, we revealed that the enhanced odor response is related to a strengthening of inhibitory AWCAIY synaptic transmission in the olfactory circuit. Consistently, inserting in this circuit an engineered electrical synapse that diminishes AWC inhibition of AIY counteracted the locomotion changes in touch-deficient mutants. We found that this cross-modal signaling between the mechanosensory and olfactory circuits is mediated by neuropeptides, one of which we identified as FLP-20. Our results indicate that under normal function, ongoing touch receptor neuron activation evokes FLP-20 release, suppressing synaptic communication and thus dampening odor sensation. In contrast, in the absence of mechanosensory input, FLP-20 signaling is reduced, synaptic suppression is released, and this enables enhanced olfactory acuity; these changes are long lasting and do not represent ongoing modulation, as revealed by optogenetic experiments. Our work adds to a growing literature on the roles of neuropeptides in cross-modal signaling, by showing how activity-dependent neuropeptide signaling leads to specific cross-modal plastic changes in neural circuit connectivity, enhancing sensory performance.\",\n",

GnIH and GnIH precursor gene related peptides have a characteristic C-terminal LPXRFamide (X = L or Q) motif that is conserved in jawed vertebrates. Orthologous peptides to GnIH are also named RFamide related peptide or LPXRFamide peptide from their structure. A G-protein coupled receptor GPR147 is the primary receptor for GnIH. Similarity-based clustering of neuropeptide precursors in metazoan species indicates that GnIH precursor of vertebrates is evolutionarily related to FMRFamide precursor of mollusk and nematode. FMRFamide peptide is the first RFamide peptide that was identified from the ganglia of the venus clam. In order to infer the evolutionary history of the GnIH-GnIH receptor system we investigate the structural similarities between GnIH and its receptor and well-studied nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> (<i>C. elegans</i>) FMRFamide-like peptides (FLPs) and their receptors. We also compare the functions of FLPs of nematode with GnIH of chordates. A multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses of GnIH, neuropeptide FF (NPFF), a paralogous peptide of GnIH, and FLP precursors have shown that GnIH and NPFF precursors belong to different clades and some FLP precursors have structural similarities to either precursor. The peptide coding regions of FLP precursors in the same clade align well with those of GnIH or NPFF precursors. Alignment of GnIH (LPXRFa) peptides of chordates and FLPs of <i>C. elegans</i> grouped the peptides into five groups according to the last C-terminal amino acid sequences, which were MRFa, LRFa, VRFa, IRFa, and PQRFa. Phylogenetic analysis of receptors suggested that GPR147 has evolutionary relationships with FLP receptors, which regulate reproduction, aggression, locomotion, and feeding. GnIH and some FLPs mediate the effect of stress on reproduction and behavior, which may also be a conserved property of these peptide systems.

Both locomotor arousal and cross-modal sensitization depend on the release of FLP-20 neuropeptides from primary mechanosensory neurons and on their receptor FRPR-3. Surprisingly, the critical site of action of FRPR-3 for both sensory and locomotor arousal is RID, a single neuroendocrine cell specialized for the release of neuropeptides that responds to mechanical stimuli in a FLP-20-dependent manner.

One factor that has previously been implicated in DCV regulation is IA-2, a catalytically inactive protein phosphatase present in DCV membranes. Our ability to directly visualize a functional, GFP-tagged version of an IA-2 homolog in live Caenorhabditis elegans animals has allowed us to capitalize on the genetics of the system to screen for mutations that disrupt DCV regulation. We found that loss of activity in the transcription factor PAG-3/Gfi-1, which functions as a repressor in many systems, results in a dramatic up-regulation of IDA-1/IA-2 and other DCV proteins. The up-regulation of DCV components was accompanied by an increase in presynaptic DCV numbers and resulted in phenotypes consistent with increased neuroendocrine secretion. Double mutant combinations revealed that these PAG-3 mutant phenotypes were dependent on wild type IDA-1 function. Our results support a model in which IDA-1/IA-2 is a critical element in DCV regulation and reveal a novel genetic link to PAG-3-mediated transcriptional regulation. To our knowledge, this is the first mutation identified that results in increased neurosecretion, a phenotype that has clinical implications for DCV-mediated secretory disorders.\",\n",

This response is mediated by a cGMP signaling pathway that includes the cGMP-gated heteromeric channel TAX-2/TAX-4.

Novel assays for dense-core vesicle exocytosis were developed by expressing a prepro-atrial natriuretic factor-green fluorescent protein fusion protein in C. elegans. unc-31 mutants exhibited reduced peptide release in vivo and lacked evoked peptide release in cultured neurons.

Conversely, UNC-13, which exhibits sequence homology to CAPS/UNC-31, was found to be essential for synaptic vesicle but not dense-core vesicle exocytosis.

Cell nonautonomous inhibitory cues, which limit tissue-specific growth alterations, are not well characterized due to cell ablation approach limitations. In this study, we employed the auxin-inducible degradation system in C. elegans to temporally and spatially modulate ribosome biogenesis, through depletion of essential factors (RPOA-2, GRWD-1, or TSR-2). Our findings reveal that embryo-wide inhibition of ribosome biogenesis induces a reversible early larval growth quiescence, distinguished by a unique gene expression signature that is different from starvation or dauer stages. When ribosome biogenesis is inhibited in volumetrically similar tissues, including body wall muscle, epidermis, pharynx, intestine, or germ line, it results in proportionally stunted growth across the organism to different degrees. We show that specifically inhibiting ribosome biogenesis in the epidermis is sufficient to trigger an organism-wide growth quiescence. Epidermis-specific ribosome depletion led to larval growth quiescence at the L3 stage, reduced organism-wide protein synthesis, and induced cell nonautonomous gene expression alterations. Further molecular analysis reveals overexpression of secreted proteins, suggesting an organism-wide regulatory mechanism. We find that UNC-31, a dense-core vesicle (DCV) pathway component, plays a significant role in epidermal ribosome biogenesis-mediated growth quiescence. Our tissue-specific knockdown experiments reveal that the organism-wide growth quiescence induced by epidermal-specific ribosome biogenesis inhibition is suppressed by reducing unc-31 expression in the epidermis, but not in neurons or body wall muscles. Similarly, IDA-1, a membrane-associated protein of the DCV, is overexpressed, and its knockdown in epidermis suppresses the organism-wide growth quiescence in response to epidermal ribosome biogenesis inhibition. Finally, we observe an overall increase in DCV puncta labeled by IDA-1 when epidermal ribosome biogenesis is inhibited, and these puncta are present in or near epidermal cells. In conclusion, these findings suggest a novel mechanism of nutrition-independent multicellular growth coordination initiated from the epidermis tissue upon ribosome biogenesis inhibition.\",\n",

With its sequenced genome and simple, well-defined neuroanatomy, the nematode, C. elegans is useful model system in which to correlate gene expression with neuron identity. The UNC-4 transcription factor is expressed in thirteen embryonic motor neurons where it specifies axonal morphology and synaptic function. These cells can be marked with an unc-4::GFP reporter transgene. Here we describe a new, powerful strategy, Micro-Array Profiling of C. elegans cells (MAPCeL) for fingerprinting isolated C. elegans cells and confirm that this approach provides a comprehensive gene expression profile of unc-4::GFP motor neurons in vivo. RESULTS: Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) was used to isolate unc-4::GFP neurons from primary cultures of C. elegans embryonic cells. Microarray experiments detected 6,217 unique transcripts of which ~1,000 are enriched in unc-4::GFP neurons relative to the average nematode embryonic cell. The reliability of these data was validated by the detection of known cell-specific transcripts and by expression in UNC-4 motor neurons of GFP reporters derived from the enriched data set. In addition to genes involved in neurotransmitter packaging and release, the microarray data include transcripts for receptors to a remarkably wide variety of signaling molecules. The added presence of a robust array of G-protein pathway components is indicative of complex and highly integrated mechanisms for modulating motor neuron activity. Over half of the enriched genes (537) have human homologs, a finding that could reflect substantial overlap with the gene expression repertoire of mammalian motor neurons. CONCLUSIONS: We have described a microarray-based method, MAPCeL, for profiling gene expression in specific C. elegans motor neurons and provide evidence that this approach can reveal candidate genes for key roles in the differentiation and function of these cells. These methods can now be applied to generate a gene expression map of the C. elegans nervous system.\",\n",

The behavioral response to EGF is mediated by EGFR activity within a single cell, the ALA neuron, and mutations that impair ALA differentiation are expected to confer EGF-resistance.

One of these corresponds to the LIM class homeodomain (HD) protein CEH-14/Lhx3, and the other two correspond to Paired-like HD proteins CEH-10/Chx10 and CEH-17/Phox2.

We present evidence that CEH-17 participates in a positive autoregulatory loop with CEH-14 in ALA, and that CEH-10, in addition to its role in ALA differentiation, functions in the generation of the ALA neuron. Similarly to CEH-17, CEH-10 is required for the posterior migration of the ALA axons, but CEH-14 appears to regulate an aspect of ALA axon outgrowth that is distinct from that of the Prd-like proteins.

Conclusions: Using an approach that combines human epigenetics and C. elegans sleep studies, we identified 5 genes that play previously unidentified roles in C. elegans sleep. We suggest sleep duration in humans may be associated with differential DNA methylation at specific sites and that the conserved genes identified here likely play roles in C. elegans sleep and in other species.\",\n",

In the worm C. elegans, lack of the RFX transcription factor DAF-19 leads to the complete absence of cilia normally found on 60 sensory neurons. We now describe and functionally characterize three different isoforms of DAF-19. The short isoform DAF-19C is specifically expressed in ciliated sensory neurons and sufficient to rescue all cilia-related phenotypes of daf-19 mutants. In contrast, the long isoforms DAF-19A/B function in basically all nonciliated neurons. We discovered behavioral and cellular phenotypes in daf-19 mutants that depend on the isoforms daf-19a/b. These novel synaptic maintenance phenotypes are reminiscent of synaptic decline seen in many human neurodegenerative disorders. C. elegans daf-19 mutant worms can thus serve as a molecular model for the mechanisms of functional neuronal decline.\",\n",

Based on sequence analysis, IA-2 and IA-2beta are transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatases but lack phosphatase activity because of critical amino acid substitutions in the catalytic domain. We studied the evolutionary conservation of IA-2 and IA-2beta genes and searched for homologs in non-mammalian vertebrates and invertebrates. METHODS: IA-2 from various species was identified from EST sequences or cloned from cDNA libraries or both. Expression in tissues was determined by transfection and in situ hybridization. RESULTS: We identified homologs of IA-2 in C. elegans, Drosophila, and zebrafish which showed 46, 58 and 82 % identity and 60, 65 and 87 % similarity, respectively, to the amino acids of the intracellular domain of human IA-2. Further studies showed that IA-2 was expressed in the neural tissues of the three species. Comparison of the genomic structure of the intracellular domain of human IA-2 with that of human IA-2beta showed that they were nearly identical and comparison of the intron-exon boundaries of Drosophila IA-2 with human IA-2 and IA-2beta showed a high degree of relatedness. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Based on these findings and sequence analysis of IA-2 homologs in mammals, we conclude that there is an IA-2 gene family which is a part of the larger protein tyrosine phosphatase superfamily. The IA-2 and IA-2beta genes represent two distinct subgroups within the IA-2 family which originated over 500 million years ago, long before the development of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans.\",\n",

In the present study, we find that knock-out of C. elegans chdp-1, which encodes a cell cortex-localized protein, causes dendrite formation defects in the larval stages and spontaneous dendrite degeneration in adults. Actin assembly in the dendritic growth cones is significantly reduced in the chdp-1 mutants. PVD neurons sense muscle contraction and act as proprioceptors. Loss of chdp-1 abolishes proprioception, which can be rescued by expressing CHDP-1 in the PVD neurons. In the high-ordered branches, loss of chdp-1 also severely affects the microtubule cytoskeleton assembly, intracellular organelle transport and neuropeptide secretion. Interestingly, knock-out of sax-1, which encodes an evolutionary conserved serine/threonine protein kinase, suppresses the defects mentioned above in chdp-1 mutants.

Both receptors and ligands share a high degree of structural similarity with their vertebrate and arthropod counterparts and also display similar biological activities with respect to digestive enzyme secretion and fat storage. Our data indicate that the gastrin-CCK signaling system was already well established prior to the divergence of Protostomes and Deuterostomes.\",\n",

As a multifunctional neuropeptide, SKs are involved in muscle contractions as well as food intake regulation in many insects. In the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum, the action on food intake by a series of synthetic SK analogs and one putative antagonist was investigated by injection in beetle adults. The most remarkable result was that both sulfated and non-sulfated SKs [FDDY(SO3H)GHMRFamide] inhibited food intake by about 70%. Strong activity observed for SK analogs featuring a residue that mimics the acidic nature of Tyr(SO3H) but lack the phenyl ring of Tyr, indicate that aromaticity is not a critical characteristic for this position of the peptide. SK demonstrated considerable tolerance to Ser and Ala substitution in position 8 (basic Arg), as analogs featuring these uncharged substitutions retained almost all of the food intake inhibitory activity. Also, the Phe in position 1 could be replaced by Ser without complete loss of activity. Conversely, substitution of Met by Nle in position 7 led to inactive compounds. Finally, the Caenorhabditis elegans sulfated neuropeptide-like protein-12 (NLP-12), that shares some sequence similarities with the SKs but features a Gln-Phe-amide rather than an Arg-Phe-amide at the C-terminus, elicited increased food intake in T. castaneum, which may indicate an antagonist activity. Co-injection of NLP-12 with nsSK blocked the food intake inhibitory effects of nsSK.\",\n",

Infection of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans by the natural fungal pathogen Drechmeria coniospora induces the expression in the epidermis of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes such as nlp-29. Here, we tested the hypothesis that injury might also alter AMP gene expression and sought to characterize the mechanisms that regulate the innate immune response. RESULTS: Injury induces a wound-healing response in C. elegans that includes induction of nlp-29 in the epidermis. We find that a conserved p38-MAP kinase cascade is required in the epidermis for the response to both infection and wounding. Through a forward genetic screen, we isolated mutants that failed to induce nlp-29 expression after D. coniospora infection. We identify a kinase, NIPI-3, related to human Tribbles homolog 1, that is likely to act upstream of the MAPKK SEK-1. We find NIPI-3 is required only for nlp-29 induction after infection and not after wounding. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the C. elegans epidermis actively responds to wounding and infection via distinct pathways that converge on a conserved signaling cassette that controls the expression of the AMP gene nlp-29.

Hence, there is great interest in understanding how levels of these enzymes are regulated. CnC transcription factors, such as mammalian Nrf2, drive the expression of phase 2 enzymes and are activated as an important conserved response to oxidative stress and xenobiotics. For instance, the Caenorhabditis elegans Nrf2 orthologue, SKN-1, is activated in response to arsenite by the stress-activated p38-related kinase, PMK-1, leading to increased expression of phase 2 enzymes. Here we have used a genome-wide screening approach to identify other C. elegans genes that are required for stress-induced increases in phase 2 detoxification gene expression. RESULTS: Taking advantage of the elevated phase 2 gene expression in a mutant lacking the peroxidase PRDX-2, we have identified many new genes that are required for stress-induced expression of gcs-1, a phase 2 enzyme critically required for glutathione synthesis. Significantly, these include genes previously implicated in resistance to ionizing radiation, longevity and responses to pathogenic infection. Many of these new candidate activators of gcs-1 are also required for the stress-induced intestinal expression of other phase 2 genes. However, intriguingly, our data suggest other factors may be specifically required for the stress-induced expression of gcs-1. Notably, we demonstrate that the candidate activator TIR-1(SARM1) and the MAPKKK NSY-1(Ask1) are required for the arsenite-induced activation of PMK-1. However, our data suggest that the majority of candidates participate in novel mechanisms to promote gcs-1 expression. For example, the E4 ubiquitin ligase UFD-2(UBE4B) is dispensable for PMK-1 activation but important for maintaining nuclear levels of SKN-1, the stress-induced expression of multiple SKN-1-target genes and oxidative stress resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Here we present the first functional, genome-wide analysis identifying genes that are required for activation of phase 2 detoxification genes in an animal. Our study identifies potential new regulators of Nrf2, reveals that additional mechanisms promote the stress-induced expression of specific phase 2 detoxification genes and provides new insight into the relationships between these universally important stress defences, oxidative stress resistance and aging.\",\n",

In addition, mir-71 is sufficient to inhibit tir-1 expression in AWC through the mir-71 complementary site in the tir-1 3' UTR. Our genetic studies suggest that mir-71 acts downstream of nsy-4 and nsy-5 to promote the AWC(ON) identity in a cell autonomous manner.

We revealed that C. acnes type strain ATCC 6919 caused lethal infections to C. elegans in solid and liquid culture media (p&lt;0.0001). Compared with the strain ATCC 6919, the antibiotic-resistant strain HM-513 was more virulent, resulting in reduced survival (p&lt;0.0001). Four different C. acnes strains killed worms with a p value of less than 0.0001 when provided to C. elegans at 4.8x10<sup>8</sup> CFU/mL. The infection model was also employed to explore host defense responses. An increase in numerous immune effectors in response to C. acnes was detected. We focused on nine C-type lectins, including: clec-13, clec-17, clec-47, clec-52, clec-60, clec-61, clec-70, clec-71, and clec-227. The induced expression of these C-type lectin genes was down-regulated in mutant worms deficient in the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Meanwhile, PMK-1 (MAPK) was phosphorylated and activated at the onset of C. acnes infection. By monitoring the survival of mutant worms, we found that PMK-1, SEK-1 (MAPKK), and TIR-1 (MAPKKK) were critical in responding to C. acnes infection. C. elegans pmk-1 and tir-1 mutants exhibited higher mortality to C. acnes infection (p&lt;0.0001).

The increased regeneration in tir-1 mutants is not a secondary consequence of its effects on degeneration, nor is it determined by the NADase activity of TIR-1.

In parallel, we found that the ability to cell-intrinsically inhibit axon regeneration is conserved in human SARM1.

We identify several families of genes encoding putative antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and proteins that are transcriptionally up-regulated upon infection. Many are located in small genomic clusters. We focus on the nlp-29 cluster of six AMP genes and show that it enhances pathogen resistance in vivo. The same cluster has a different structure in two other Caenorhabditis species. A phylogenetic analysis indicates that the evolutionary diversification of this cluster, especially in cases of intra-genomic gene duplications, is driven by natural selection. We further show that upon osmotic stress, two genes of the nlp-29 cluster are strongly induced. In contrast to fungus-induced nlp expression, this response is independent of the p38 MAP kinase cascade. At the same time, both involve the epidermal GATA factor ELT-3.

Signaling between AWC neurons induces left-right asymmetry through a gap junction network and a claudin-related protein, which inhibit a calcium-regulated MAP kinase pathway in the neuron that becomes AWCON. RESULTS: We show here that the asymmetry gene olrn-1 acts downstream of the gap junction and claudin genes to inhibit the calcium-MAP kinase pathway in AWCON. OLRN-1, a protein with potential membrane-association domains, is related to the Drosophila Raw protein, a negative regulator of JNK mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling. olrn-1 opposes the action of two voltage-activated calcium channel homologs, unc-2 (CaV2) and egl-19 (CaV1), which act together to stimulate the calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase CaMKII and the MAP kinase pathway. Calcium channel activity is essential in AWCOFF, and the two AWC neurons coordinate left-right asymmetry using signals from the calcium channels and signals from olrn-1. CONCLUSIONS: olrn-1 and voltage-activated calcium channels are mediators and targets of AWC signaling that act at the transition between a multicellular signaling network and cell-autonomous execution of the decision.

Through visualization of fluorescently labeled TIR-1/SARM1 protein, we demonstrate that physiologic stresses, both pathogen and non-pathogen, induce multimerization of TIR-1/SARM1 into visible puncta within intestinal epithelial cells. In vitro enzyme kinetic analyses revealed that, like mammalian SARM1, the NAD+ glycohydrolase activity of C. elegans TIR-1 is dramatically potentiated by protein oligomerization and a phase transition. Accordingly, C. elegans with genetic mutations that specifically block either multimerization or the NAD+ glycohydrolase activity of TIR-1/SARM1 fail to induce p38 PMK phosphorylation, are unable to increase immune effector expression, and are dramatically susceptible to bacterial infection. Finally, we demonstrate that a loss-of-function mutation in nhr-8, which alters cholesterol metabolism and is used to study conditions of sterol deficiency, causes TIR-1/SARM1 to oligomerize into puncta in intestinal epithelial cells. Cholesterol scarcity increases p38 PMK-1 phosphorylation, primes immune effector induction in a manner that requires TIR-1/SARM1 oligomerization and its intrinsic NAD+ glycohydrolase activity, and reduces pathogen accumulation in the intestine during a subsequent infection. These data reveal a new adaptive response that allows a metazoan host to anticipate pathogen threats during cholesterol deprivation, a time of relative susceptibility to infection. Thus, a phase transition of TIR-1/SARM1 as a prerequisite for its NAD+ glycohydrolase activity is strongly conserved across millions of years of evolution and is essential for diverse physiological processes in multiple cell types.\",\n",

To further investigate the mechanism of Hmc inhibition, we chose the classical innate immune model organism Caenorhabditis elegans as the study subject. In this investigation, we found that Hmc treatment directly reduced the number of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in the intestine of infected wild-type nematodes and infected pmk-1 mutant nematodes. Hmc treatment significantly prolonged the life span of infected wild-type nematodes and increased the expression of antimicrobial effectors (<i>clec-82</i>, <i>nlp-29</i>, <i>lys-1</i>, <i>lys-7</i>), and Hmc treatment still significantly increased the expression of antimicrobial effectors (<i>clec-82</i>, <i>nlp-29</i>, <i>lys-7</i>) in wild-type nematodes in the absence of bacterial stimulation.

In order to understand the genetic basis of L/R asymmetry establishment, we screened for mutants in which patterns of asymmetric gcy gene expression are disrupted, and we identified a cascade of several symmetrically and asymmetrically expressed transcription factors that are sequentially required to restrict gcy gene expression to either the left or right ASE cell.

As skn-1 induces phase 2 detoxification enzymes, our findings suggest that cell wall components of bifidobacteria increase the average lifespan of C. elegans via activation of skn-1, regulated by the p38 MAPK pathway, but not by general activation of the host defense system via DAF-16.\",\n",

Here, we identify transcription factors downstream of the TIR-1 signaling pathway. We show that common transcription factors control the innate immunity and 5-HT biosynthesis. We demonstrate that a cysteine to tyrosine substitution in an ARM motif of the HEAT/Arm repeat region of the TIR-1 protein confers TIR-1 hyperactivation, leading to constitutive tph-1 upregulation in the ADF neurons, increased expression of intestinal antimicrobial genes, and enhanced resistance to killing by the human opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14. A forward genetic screen for suppressors of the hyperactive TIR-1 led to the identification of DAF-19, an ortholog of regulatory factor X (RFX) transcription factors that are required for human adaptive immunity. We show that DAF-19 concerts with ATF-7, a member of the activating transcription factor (ATF)/cAMP response element-binding B (CREB) family of transcription factors, to regulate tph-1 and antimicrobial genes, reminiscent of RFX-CREB interaction in human immune cells. daf-19 mutants display heightened susceptibility to killing by PA14. Remarkably, whereas the TIR-1-MAPK-DAF-19/ATF-7 pathway in the intestinal immunity is regulated by DKF-2/protein kinase D, we found that the regulation of tph-1 expression is independent of DKF-2 but requires UNC-43/Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) II.

One major mechanism of osmotic homeostasis involves the upregulation of proteins that catalyze the accumulation of solutes called organic osmolytes. To better understand how osmolyte accumulation proteins are regulated, we conducted a forward genetic screen in C. elegans for mutants with no induction of osmolyte biosynthesis gene expression (Nio mutants). The nio-3 mutant encoded a missense mutation in cpf-2/CstF64 while the nio-7 mutant encoded a missense mutation in symk-1/Symplekin. Both cpf-2 and symk-1 are nuclear components of the highly conserved 3' mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation complex. cpf-2 and symk-1 block the hypertonic induction of gpdh-1 and other osmotically induced mRNAs, suggesting they act at the transcriptional level. We generated a functional auxin-inducible degron (AID) allele for symk-1 and found that acute, post-developmental degradation in the intestine and hypodermis was sufficient to cause the Nio phenotype. symk-1 and cpf-2 exhibit genetic interactions that strongly suggest they function through alterations in 3' mRNA cleavage and/or alternative polyadenylation. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that inhibition of several other components of the mRNA cleavage complex also cause a Nio phenotype. cpf-2 and symk-1 specifically affect the osmotic stress response since heat shock-induced upregulation of a hsp-16.2::GFP reporter is normal in these mutants.

Whether such an inducible system of innate immunity is present in the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is currently an open question. Among conserved signaling pathways important for innate immunity, the Toll pathway is the best characterized. In Drosophila, this pathway also has an essential developmental role. C. elegans possesses structural homologs of components of this pathway, and this observation raises the possibility that a Toll pathway might also function in nematodes to trigger defense mechanisms or to control development. Results: We have generated and characterized deletion mutants for four genes supposed to function in a nematode Toll signaling pathway. These genes are tol-1, trf-1, pik-1, and ikb-1 and are homologous to the Drosophila melanogaster Toll, dTraf pelle, and cactus genes, respectively. Of these four genes, only tol-l is required for nematode development. None of them are important for the resistance of C. elegans to a number of pathogens. On the other hand, C. elegans is capable of distinguishing different bacterial species and has a tendency to avoid certain pathogens, including Serratia marcescens. The tol-1 mutants are defective in their avoidance of pathogenic S. marcescens, although other chemosensory behaviors are wild type. Conclusions: In C. elegans, tol-1 is important for development and pathogen recognition, as is Toll in Drosophila, but remarkably for the latter role, it functions in the context of a behavioral mechanism that keeps worms away from potential danger.\",\n",

Regulatory regions of ADF effector genes contain functional LAG-1 binding sites that mediate activation but not basal repression. lag-1 mutants show broad defects in ADF effector genes activation, and LAG-1 is required to maintain ADF cell fate and functions throughout life. Unexpectedly, contrary to reported basal repression state for LAG-1 prior to Notch receptor activation, gene expression activation in the ADF neuron by LAG-1 does not require Notch signalling, demonstrating a default activator state for LAG-1 independent of Notch.

The interdependence of roundworms and their environmental microbes, including their microbiota, offers an opportunity for developing more targeted anthelminthic strategies. However, paucity of information and a currently narrow understanding of nematode-microbe interactions limited to specific infection contexts has precluded us from exploiting it. With the advent of omics approaches to map host-microbe genetic interactions, particularly in the model roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, large datasets are now available across multiple models, that enable identification of nematode-microbe-specific pathways. In this work we collected 20 transcriptomic datasets documenting gene expression changes of C. elegans exposed to 20 different commensal and pathogenic microbes, performing gene enrichment analyses followed by functional testing using RNA interference directed toward genes of interest, before contrasting results from transcriptomic meta-analyses and phenomics. Differential expression analyses revealed a broad enrichment in signaling, innate immune response and (lipid) metabolism genes. Amongst signaling gene families, the nematode-divergent and expanded Hedgehog-like signaling (HHLS) pathway featured prominently. Indeed, 24/60 C. elegans Hedgehog-like proteins (HRPs) and 15/27 Patched-related receptors (PTRs) were differentially expressed in at least four microbial contexts, while up to 32/60 HRPs could be differentially expressed in a single context. interestingly, differentially expressed genes followed a microbe-specific pattern, suggestive of an adaptive microbe-specific response. To investigate this further, we knocked-down 96 individual HHLS genes by RNAi, using high-throughput assays to assess their impact on three worm-gut infection models (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis) and two worm-commensal paradigms (Comamonas sp., and Bacillus subtilis). We notably identified new putative infection response genes whose upregulation was required for normal pathogen resistance (i.e., grl-21 and ptr-18 protective against E. faecalis), as well as commensal-specific host-gene expression changes that are required for normal host stress handling. Importantly, interactions appeared more microbe-specific than shared. Our results thus implicate the Hedgehog-like signaling pathway in the modulation and possibly fine-tuning of nematode-microbe interactions and support the idea that interventions targeting this pathway may provide a new avenue for anthelmintic development.\",\n",

To elucidate the mechanisms of forgetting, we used one of the behavioral plasticities of C. elegans hermaphrodite, olfactory adaptation to an attractive odorant, diacetyl, as a simple model of learning. In C. elegans, the TIR-1/JNK-1 pathway accelerates forgetting of olfactory adaptation by facilitating neural secretion from AWC sensory neurons. In this study, to identify the downstream effectors of the TIR-1/JNK-1 pathway, we conducted a genetic screen for suppressors of the gain-of-function mutant of tir-1 (ok1052), which shows excessive forgetting. Our screening showed that three proteins, a membrane protein, MACO-1, a receptor tyrosine kinase, SCD-2, and its putative ligand, HEN-1, regulated forgetting downstream of the TIR-1/JNK-1 pathway. We further demonstrated that MACO-1 and SCD-2/HEN-1 functioned in parallel genetic pathways, and only MACO-1 regulated forgetting of olfactory adaptation to isoamyl alcohol, which is an attractive odorant sensed by different types of sensory neurons. In olfactory adaptation, odor-evoked Ca(2+) responses in olfactory neurons are attenuated by conditioning and recovered thereafter. Ca(2+) imaging study revealed that this attenuation is sustained longer in maco-1 and scd-2 mutant animals than in wild-type animals like the TIR-1/JNK-1 pathway mutants. Furthermore, temporal silencing by histamine-gated chloride channels revealed that the neuronal activity of AWC neurons after conditioning is important for proper forgetting.

Notably, the lifespan of worms fed MI-OMU01 was significantly longer than that of the animals fed OP50. Moreover, MI-OMU01 increased the resistance of C. elegans to several stressors including UV irradiation, H2O2, and Cu2+. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic and gene expression analyses using mutant animals suggested that MI-OMU01 extended the lifespan of worms in TIR-1/SARM, p38 MAPK, and insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) pathway-dependent manners.\",\n",

Here, we show that in C.elegans, inherited small RNAs control genetic variation by regulating the crucial decision of whether to self-fertilize or outcross. We found that under stressful temperatures, younger hermaphrodites secrete a male-attracting pheromone. Attractiveness transmits transgenerationally to unstressed progeny via heritable small RNAs and the Argonaute Heritable RNAi Deficient-1 (HRDE-1). We identified an endogenous small interfering RNA pathway, enriched in endo-siRNAs that target sperm genes, that transgenerationally regulates sexual attraction, male prevalence, and outcrossing rates. Multigenerational mating competition experiments and mathematical simulations revealed that over generations, animals that inherit attractiveness mate more and their alleles spread in the population. We propose that the sperm serves as a \\\"stress-sensor\\\" that, via small RNA inheritance, promotes outcrossing in challenging environments when increasing genetic variation is advantageous.\",\n",

Alterations in mitochondrial activity not only influence individual cell function but also, through non-cell autonomous mechanisms, whole body metabolism, healthspan and lifespan. Energy homeostasis is orchestrated by the complex interplay between mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondria-selective autophagy (mitophagy). However, the cellular and molecular pathways that coordinate these 2 opposing processes remained obscure. In our recent study, we demonstrate that DCT-1, the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog of the mammalian BNIP3 and BNIP3L/NIX, is a key mediator of mitophagy, and functions in the same genetic pathway with PINK-1 and PDR-1 (the nematode homologs of PINK1 and Parkin respectively) to promote longevity and prevent cell damage under stress conditions. Interestingly, accumulation of damaged mitochondria activates SKN-1 (SKiNhead-1), the nematode homolog of NRF2, which in turn initiates a compensatory retrograde signaling response that impinges on both mitochondrial biogenesis and removal. In this commentary, we discuss the implications of these new findings in the context of innate immunity and aging. Unraveling the regulatory network that governs the crosstalk between mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy will enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that link aberrant energy metabolism to aging and disease.\",\n",

We show that linker-cell death requires the gene pqn-41, encoding an endogenous polyglutamine-repeat protein. pqn-41 functions cell-autonomously and is expressed at the onset of linker-cell death. pqn-41 expression is controlled by the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase SEK-1, which functions in parallel to the zinc-finger protein LIN-29 to promote cellular demise.

Here we show that SKN-1 is required for C. elegans pathogen resistance against both Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis bacteria. Exposure to P. aeruginosa leads to SKN-1 accumulation in intestinal nuclei and transcriptional activation of two SKN-1 target genes, gcs-1 and gst-4. Both the Toll/IL-1 Receptor domain protein TIR-1 and the p38 MAPK PMK-1 are required for SKN-1 activation by PA14 exposure. We demonstrate an early onset of immunosenescence with a concomitant age-dependent decline in SKN-1-dependent target gene activation, and a requirement of SKN-1 to enhance pathogen resistance in response to longevity-promoting interventions, such as reduced insulin/IGF-like signaling and preconditioning H(2)O(2) treatment. Finally, we find that wdr-23(RNAi)-mediated constitutive SKN-1 activation results in excessive transcription of target genes, confers oxidative stress tolerance, but impairs pathogen resistance.

Furthermore, in mammalian systems the genetic analysis of physiological targets of p38 MAPK in immunity has been limited. Here, we show that C. elegans ATF-7, a member of the conserved cyclic AMP-responsive element binding (CREB)/activating transcription factor (ATF) family of basic-region leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors and an ortholog of mammalian ATF2/ATF7, has a pivotal role in the regulation of PMK-1-mediated innate immunity. Genetic analysis of loss-of-function alleles and a gain-of-function allele of atf-7, combined with expression analysis of PMK-1-regulated genes and biochemical characterization of the interaction between ATF-7 and PMK-1, suggest that ATF-7 functions as a repressor of PMK-1-regulated genes that undergoes a switch to an activator upon phosphorylation by PMK-1. Whereas loss-of-function mutations in atf-7 can restore basal expression of PMK-1-regulated genes observed in the pmk-1 null mutant, the induction of PMK-1-regulated genes by pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 is abrogated. The switching modes of ATF-7 activity, from repressor to activator in response to activated PMK-1 p38 MAPK, are reminiscent of the mechanism of regulation mediated by the corresponding ancestral Sko1p and Hog1p proteins in the yeast response to osmotic stress. Our data point to the regulation of the ATF2/ATF7/CREB5 family of transcriptional regulators by p38 MAPK as an ancient conserved mechanism for the control of innate immunity in metazoans, and suggest that ATF2/ATF7 may function in a similar manner in the regulation of mammalian innate immunity.\",\n",

These strains contained hypomorphic mutations in each of the known components of the p38 MAP kinase cassette (tir-1, nsy-1, sek-1 and pmk-1), demonstrating that hyperstimulation of p38 MAPK innate immune responses is toxic to animals. To explore mechanisms of immune pathway regulation in C. elegans, we conducted another genetic screen for dominant activators of the p38 MAPK pathway and identified a single allele that had a gain-of-function (gf) mutation in nsy-1, the MAP kinase kinase kinase that acts upstream of p38 MAPK pmk-1. The nsy-1(gf) allele caused hyperinduction of p38 MAPK PMK-1-dependent immune effectors, had greater levels of phosphorylated p38 MAPK and was more resistant to killing by the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa compared to wild-type controls.

The pan-neuronal rescue of RAC-2 or JNK-1, instead of AWC neuron-specific expression, reverses the delayed forgetting caused by the rac-2 mutation, which indicates that the involvement of RAC-2/JNK-1 in more than AWCs must be required. In summary, our work elucidates the action of the Rho GTPase RAC-2 and downstream JNK-1 as a potential novel pathway in forgetting in C. elegans.\",\n",

Sterile alpha and Toll/interleukin receptor (TIR) motif-containing protein 1 (SARM1) is an evolutionarily conserved executioner of this degeneration cascade, also known as Wallerian degeneration; however, the mechanism of SARM1-dependent neuronal destruction is still obscure. SARM1 possesses a TIR domain that is necessary for SARM1 activity. In other proteins, dimerized TIR domains serve as scaffolds for innate immune signaling. In contrast, dimerization of the SARM1 TIR domain promotes consumption of the essential metabolite NAD(+) and induces neuronal destruction. This activity is unique to the SARM1 TIR domain, yet the structural elements that enable this activity are unknown. In this study, we identify fundamental properties of the SARM1 TIR domain that promote NAD(+) loss and axon degeneration. Dimerization of the TIR domain from the Caenorhabditis elegans SARM1 ortholog TIR-1 leads to NAD(+) loss and neuronal death, indicating these activities are an evolutionarily conserved feature of SARM1 function. Detailed analysis of sequence homology identifies canonical TIR motifs as well as a SARM1-specific (SS) loop that are required for NAD(+) loss and axon degeneration. Furthermore, we identify a residue in the SARM1 BB loop that is dispensable for TIR activity yet required for injury-induced activation of full-length SARM1, suggesting that SARM1 function requires multidomain interactions. Indeed, we identify a physical interaction between the autoinhibitory N terminus and the TIR domain of SARM1, revealing a previously unrecognized direct connection between these domains that we propose mediates autoinhibition and activation upon injury.\",\n",

The current study reveals that deficiency of innate immunity triggered by mutation of the classic immune gene <i>pmk-1</i> promotes avoidance behavior in <i>C. elegans</i>; and vice versa.

Unlike the original SynMuv screens, our approach is completely nonbiased and can theoretically be applied to any situation in which a mutation fails to produce a detectable phenotype. From this screen we have identified fzr-1, a gene that synthetically interacts with lin-35 to produce global defects in cell proliferation control. fzr-1 encodes the C. elegans homolog of Cdh1/Hct1/FZR, a gene product shown in other systems to regulate the APC cyclosome. We have also uncovered genetic interactions between fzr-1 and a subset of class B SynMuv genes, and between lin-35 and the putative SCF regulator lin-23.

Through interactions with molecular partners at cell junctions, they provide a connection between the ECM and the cytoskeleton and regulate many aspects of cell behavior. A number of integrin-associated molecules have been identified; however, in many cases, their function and role in the animal remain to be clarified. Results: We have identified the Nck-interacting kinase (NIK), a member of the STE20/germinal center kinase (GCK) family, as a partner for the beta1A integrin cytoplasmic domain. We find that NIK is expressed in the nervous system and other tissues in mouse embryos and colocalizes with actin and beta1 integrin in cellular protrusions in transfected cells. To demonstrate the functional significance of this interaction, we used Caenorhabditis elegans, since it has only one beta (PAT-3) integrin chain, two alpha (INA-1 and PAT-2) integrin chains, and a well-conserved NIK ortholog (MIG-15). Using three methods, we show that reducing mig-15 activity results in premature branching of commissures. A significant aggravation of this defect is observed when mig-15 activity is compromised in a weak ina-1 background. Neuronal-specific RNA interference against mig-15 or pat-3 leads to similar axonal defects, thus showing that both mig-15 and pat-3 act cell autonomously in neurons. Finally, we show a genetic interaction between mig-15, ina-1, and genes that encode Rac GTPases. Conclusions. Using several models, we provide the first evidence that the kinase NIK and integrins interact in vitro and in vivo. This interaction is required for proper axonal navigation in C.\",\n",

However, how these positive and negative functions of electrical synapses are coordinated to shape rhythmic synaptic outputs and behavior is not well understood. Here, using a combination of genetics, behavioral analysis, and live calcium imaging in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, we show that electrical synapses formed by the gap junction protein INX-1/innexin couple the presynaptic terminals of a pair of motor neurons (AVL and DVB) to synchronize their activation in response to a pacemaker signal. Live calcium imaging reveals that <i>inx-1</i>/innexin mutations lead to asynchronous activation of AVL and DVB, due, in part, to loss of AVL-mediated activation of DVB by the pacemaker. In addition, loss of <i>inx-1</i> leads to the ectopic activation of DVB at inappropriate times during the cycle through the activation of the L-type voltage-gated calcium channel EGL-19. We propose that electrical synapses between AVL and DVB presynaptic terminals function to ensure the precise and robust execution of a specific step in a rhythmic behavior by both synchronizing the activities of presynaptic terminals in response to pacemaker signaling and by inhibiting their activation in between cycles when pacemaker signaling is low.\",\n",

Dynamics of the gene regulatory networks are governed by a thermodynamic model of gene expression, which uses DNA sequences and transcription factor degenerate position weight matrixes as input. In a version of the model, we included chromatin accessibility. Experimentally, it has been determined that cell-specific and broadly expressed genes are regulated differently. In our in silico evolved GRNs, broadly expressed genes are regulated very redundantly and the architecture of their cis-regulatory modules is different, in accordance to what has been found in C. elegans and also in other systems. Finally, we found differences in topological positions in GRNs between these two classes of genes, which help to explain why broadly expressed genes are so resilient to mutations. Overall, our results offer an explanatory hypothesis on why broadly expressed genes are regulated so redundantly compared to cell-specific genes, which can be extrapolated to phenomena such as ChIP-seq HOT regions.\",\n",

The neurotransmitter GABA has been reported to be co-released with its sole precursor, the neurotransmitter glutamate. The genetic and circuitry mechanisms to establish the balance between GABAergic and glutamatergic signaling have not been fully elucidated. Caenorhabditis elegans DVB is an excitatory GABAergic motoneuron that drives the expulsion step in the defecation motor program. We show here that in addition to UNC-47, the vesicular GABA transporter, DVB also expresses EAT-4, a vesicular glutamate transporter. UBR-1, a conserved ubiquitin ligase, regulates DVB activity by suppressing a bidirectional inhibitory glutamate signaling. Loss of UBR-1 impairs DVB Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and expulsion frequency. These impairments are fully compensated by the knockdown of EAT-4 in DVB. Further, glutamate-gated chloride channels GLC-3 and GLC-2/4 receive DVB's glutamate signals to inhibit DVB and enteric muscle activity, respectively. These results implicate an intrinsic cellular mechanism that promotes the inherent asymmetric neural activity. We propose that elevated glutamate in ubr-1 mutants, being the cause of the E/I shift, potentially contributes to Johanson Blizzard syndrome.\",\n",

These connections are formed by the extension of axonal processes along predetermined pathways. Axon outgrowth is directed by growth cones located at the tips of these neuronal processes. Although the behavior of growth tones has been well-characterized in vitro, it is difficult to observe growth cones in vivo. We have observed motor neuron growth cones migrating in living Caenorhabditis elegans larvae using time-lapse confocal microscopy. Specifically, we observed the VD motor neurons extend axons from the ventral to dorsal nerve cord during the L2 stage. The growth cones of these neurons are round and migrate rapidly across the epidermis if they are unobstructed. When they contact axons of the lateral nerve fascicles, growth cones stall and spread out along the fascicle to form anvil-shaped structures. After pausing for a few minutes, they extend lamellipodia beyond the fascicle and resume migration toward the dorsal nerve cord. Growth cones stall again when they contact the body wall muscles. These muscles are tightly attached to the epidermis by narrowly spaced circumferential attachment structures. Stalled growth cones extend fingers dorsally between these hypodermal attachment structures. When a single finger has projected through the body wall muscle quadrant, the growth cone located on the ventral side of the muscle collapses and a new growth cone forms at the dorsal tip of the predominating finger. Thus, we observe that complete growth cone collapse occurs in vivo and not just in culture assays. In contrast to studies indicating that collapse occurs upon contact with repulsive substrata, collapse of the VD growth cones may result from an intrinsic signal that serves to maintain growth cone primacy and conserve cellular material.\",\n",

C. elegans eri-1 was identified in a genetic screen for mutants with enhanced sensitivity to dsRNAs.

The high degree of spatial, temporal, and intensity control that can be achieved with a light stimulus, combined with cell type-specific expression of light-sensitive ion channels, enables highly specific and precise stimulation of excitable cells. Optogenetic tools have therefore revolutionized the study of neuronal circuits in a number of models, including Caenorhabditis elegans. Despite the existence of several optogenetic systems that allow spatial and temporal photoactivation of light-sensitive actuators in C. elegans, their high costs and low flexibility have limited wide access to optogenetics. Here, we developed an inexpensive, easy-to-build, modular, and adjustable optogenetics device for use on different microscopes and worm trackers, which we called the OptoArm. RESULTS: The OptoArm allows for single- and multiple-worm illumination and is adaptable in terms of light intensity, lighting profiles, and light color. We demonstrate OptoArm's power in a population-based multi-parameter study on the contributions of motor circuit cells to age-related motility decline. We found that individual components of the neuromuscular system display different rates of age-dependent deterioration. The functional decline of cholinergic neurons mirrors motor decline, while GABAergic neurons and muscle cells are relatively age-resilient, suggesting that rate-limiting cells exist and determine neuronal circuit ageing. CONCLUSION: We have assembled an economical, reliable, and highly adaptable optogenetics system which can be deployed to address diverse biological questions. We provide a detailed description of the construction as well as technical and biological validation of our set-up. Importantly, use of the OptoArm is not limited to C. elegans and may benefit studies in multiple model organisms, making optogenetics more accessible to the broader research community.\",\n",

The regulatory functions of individual homeodomain proteins and the networks in which they act are frequently highly conserved across species, although these networks may be deployed in different developmental contexts.

This gene is the terminal global regulator in a well-characterized cascade of sex-determining genes.

Previous genetic analyses have led to the characterization of many loss-of-function (masculinizing) and gain-of-function (dominant feminizing) alleles, and to models for the functions and regulation of tra-1. The gene was cloned by identifying linked transposon insertions, about 200 kb away from tra-1. From this starting point a series of YAC, cosmid and phage clones were assembled into a genomic walk covering over 400 kb. Much of this region was found to be unrepresented in the cosmid database that covers most of the C. elegans genome. This deficit is largely or wholly due to the presence of sequences that cannot be cloned in rec+bacterial hosts. The ratio of physical map distances to recombinational map distances in the tra-1 region of the genome appears to be unusually low, indicating considerable local map expansion. The location of tra-1 within the cloned region was determined using a variety of tra-1 mutations that are associated with physical rearrangements of the gene. One of these is a 14-kb deletion, which behaves as a null allele. Another rearrangement, eDp24, is a tandem duplication of 22kb. Genetic analysis demonstrates that eDp24 carries two incomplete copies of tra-1, and that these copies appear to interact, suggesting some form of negative autoregulation at this locus.

To investigate whether FB1 has neurobehavioral toxicity effects on C. elegans, the motor behavior, neuronal structure, neurotransmitter content, and gene expression related with neurotransmission of C. elegans were determined after exposed to 20-200 &#956;g/mL FB1 for 24 h and 48 h, respectively. Results showed that FB1 caused behavioral defects, including body bends, head thrashes, crawling distance, mean speed, mean amplitude, mean wavelength, foraging behavior, and chemotaxis learning ability in a dose-, and time-dependent manner. In addition, when C. elegans was exposed to FB1 at a concentration of 200 &#956;g/mL for 24 h and above 100 &#956;g/mL for 48 h, the GABAergic and serotonergic neurons were damaged, but no effect on dopaminergic, glutamatergic, and cholinergic neurons.

Because many orthologous transcription factors are also functionally conserved, one possible model to account for homologous gene expression patterns, is conservation of specific binding sites within cis-regulatory elements of orthologous genes. If this model is correct, a cis-regulatory element from one organism would be expected to function in a distantly related organism. To test this hypothesis, we fused the green fluorescent protein gene to neuronal and muscular enhancer elements from a variety of Drosophila melanogaster genes, and tested whether these would activate expression in the homologous cell types in Caenorhabditis elegans. Regulatory elements from several genes directed appropriate expression in homologous tissue types, suggesting conservation of regulatory sites. However, enhancers of most Drosophila genes tested were not properly recognized in C elegans, implying that over this evolutionary distance enough changes occurred in cis-regulatory sequences and/or transcription factors to prevent proper recognition of heterospecific enhancers. Comparisons of enhancer elements of orthologous genes between C. elegans and C. briggsae revealed extensive conservation, as well as specific instances of functional divergence. Our results indicate that functional changes in cis-regulatory sequences accumulate on timescales much shorter than the divergence of arthropods and nematodes, and that mechanisms other than conservation of individual binding sites within enhancer elements are responsible for the conservation of expression patterns of homologous genes between distantly related species.\",\n",

We have expressed VIAAT and the plasmalemmal transporters for glycine and GABA in a neuroendocrine cell line and measured the quantal release of glycine and GABA using a novel double-sniffer patch-clamp technique. We found that glycine is released from vesicles when VIAAT is coexpressed with either the neuronal transporter GlyT2 or the glial transporter GlyT1. However, GlyT2 was more effective than GlyT1, probably because GlyT2 is unable to operate in the reverse mode, which gives it an advantage in maintaining the high cytosolic glycine concentration required for efficient vesicular loading by VIAAT. The vesicular inhibitory phenotype was gradually altered from glycinergic to GABAergic through mixed events when GABA is introduced into the secretory cell and competes for uptake by VIAAT. Interestingly, the VIAAT ortholog from Caenorhabditis elegans (UNC-47), a species lacking glycine transmission, also supports glycine exocytosis in the presence of GlyT2, and a point mutation of UNC-47 that abolishes GABA transmission in the worm confers glycine specificity. Together, these results suggest that an increased cytosolic availability of glycine in VIAAT-containing terminals was crucial for the emergence of glycinergic transmission in vertebrates.\",\n",

Changes in E/I inputs can cause uncontrolled electrical discharges, mimicking the physiology of seizures. Molecules derived from 1,3,4-oxadiazole have been found to exhibit diverse biological activities, including anticonvulsant effect.

We demonstrate that MPMT-OX reduced the locomotor activity of C. elegans with a normal balance between the E/I systems and increased the resistance to paralysis in worms exposed to pentylenetetrazol and aldicarb. MPMT-OX increased seizure resistance and assisted in the recovery of locomotor activity in worms with deletions in the genes unc-46, which regulates the transport of GABA into vesicles, and unc-49, which encodes the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor. C. elegans with deletions in the unc-25 and unc-47 genes did not respond to treatment.

PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to investigate the intestinal toxicity of EFL1 and the underlying mechanisms using nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. METHODS: C. elegans were exposed to 0-200M EFL1 for 72h, then the survival rate, body length and body width, locomotion and chemoreception behavior, intestinal ROS and lipofuscin accumulation, intestinal permeability, and defecation rhythm were detected. The -aminobutyric acidGABA) energic neurons AVL and DVB were shown via green fluorescent protein under a laser scanning confocal microscope. The structure of GABA transporter UNC-47 were predicted by homology modeling, and the interaction between EFL1 and UNC-47 was simulated by molecular docking. The mRNA expression of genes related to oxidative stress, intestinal permeability and defecation after EFL1 exposure were detected by RT-qPCR. RESULTS: EFL1 did not induce lethality of nematodes. The general toxicity was characterized by abnormal growth, locomotion and chemoreception. The intestinal barrier was leaky, due to down-regulated cell junction and active cation transport. The mean defecation cycle length in nematodes was decreased, relating to disorder vesicular and ion transport, enhanced rhythm behavior and muscle contraction. The dysfunctional defecation also attributed to injured UNC-47 protein, as well as GABAergic neurons AVL and DVB. Excessive ROS and lipofuscin accumulation were observed in intestine, along with activation of antioxidant enzymes of SOD, COQ7 and CAT. CONCLUSION: This study elucidated the EFL1-induced intestinal toxicity in nematodes, characterized as leaky intestinal barrier and accelerated defecation behavior. The underlying mechanisms were involved in oxidative stress, cell junctions, transportation, rhythm behavior, muscle contraction, and GABAergic neurons.\",\n",

It remains unclear whether the seizures result from aberrant neuronal placement, disruption of intrinsic properties of neurons, or both. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans offers an opportunity to study such convulsions in a simple animal with a defined nervous system. Here we show that convulsions mimicking epilepsy can be induced by a mutation in a C. elegans lis-1 allele (pnm-1), in combination with a chemical antagonist of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitter signaling. Identical convulsions were obtained using C. elegans mutants defective in GABA transmission, whereas none of these mutants or the antagonist alone caused convulsions, indicating a threshold was exceeded in response to this combination. Crosses between pnm-1 and fluorescent marker strains designed to exclusively illuminate either the processes of GABAergic neurons or synaptic vesicles surprisingly showed no deviations in neuronal architecture. Instead, presynaptic defects in GABAergic vesicle distribution were clearly evident and could be phenocopied by RNAi directed against cytoplasmic dynein, a known LIS1 interactor. Furthermore, mutations in UNC-104, a neuronal-specific kinesin, and SNB-1, a synaptic vesicle-associated protein termed synaptobrevin, exhibit similar convulsion phenotypes following chemical induction. Taken together, these studies establish C. elegans as a system to investigate subtle cytoskeletal mechanisms regulating intrinsic neuronal activity and suggest that it may be possible to dissociate the epileptic consequences of lissencephaly from the more phenotypically overt cortical defects associated with neuronal migration.\",\n",

To identify novel cellular responses to stress, we performed transcriptional analysis in acutely stressed mouse neurons, followed by functional characterization in Caenorhabditis elegans. In both contexts, we found that the gene GDPGP1/mcp-1 is down-regulated by a variety of stresses. Functionally, the enzyme GDPGP1/mcp-1 protects against stress. Knockdown of GDPGP1 in mouse neurons leads to widespread neuronal cell death. Loss of mcp-1, the single homologue of GDPGP1 in C. elegans, leads to increased degeneration of GABA neurons as well as reduced survival of animals following environmental stress. Overexpression of mcp-1 in neurons enhances survival under hypoxia and protects against neurodegeneration in a tauopathy model. GDPGP1/mcp-1 regulates neuronal glycogen levels, indicating a key role for this metabolite in neuronal stress resistance. Together, our data indicate that down-regulation of GDPGP1/mcp-1 and consequent loss of neuronal glycogen is a maladaptive response that limits neuronal stress resistance and reduces survival.\",\n",

We show that the larval male defecates by contracting the same set of enteric muscles, and that these contractions require 12 of these 13 genes. However, near the end of the last larval stage, the male anal region undergoes a developmental change, including dramatic hypertrophy of the anal sphincter muscle and the opening of a cloacal canal. We find that this modified sphincter must now relax to permit defecation. In contrast to the larval male, we find that in the adult male only 2 of the 13 genes required for enteric muscle contraction, unc-25 and unc-47, are important for sphincter muscle relaxation. unc-25 and unc-47 are required for the synthesis and utilization of GABA. We also find that two other genes, unc-46 and unc-49, previously implicated in the inhibitory action of GABA on body-wall muscle, are also required for normal adult male sphincter relaxation. In these mutants, failure to relax the sphincter muscle results in a constipated phenotype, and killing the sphincter muscle rescues this phenotype.

Here we examine most of the genes previously identified as the sites of mutations affecting muscle for novel roles in regulating degradation. We evaluate genomic (RNAi knockdown) approaches and combine them with our established genetic (mutant) and pharmacologic (drugs) approaches to examine these 159 genes. We find that RNAi usually recapitulates both organismal and sub-cellular mutant phenotypes but RNAi, unlike mutants, can frequently be used acutely to study gene function solely in differentiated muscle. In the majority of cases where RNAi does not produce organismal level phenotypes, sub-cellular defects can be detected; disrupted proteostasis is most commonly observed. We identify 48 genes in which mutation or RNAi knockdown causes excessive protein degradation; myofibrillar and/or mitochondrial morphologies are also disrupted in 19 of these 48 cases. These 48 genes appear to act via at least three sub-networks to control bulk degradation of protein in muscle cytosol. Attachment to the extracellular matrix regulates degradation via unidentified proteases and affects myofibrillar and mitochondrial morphology. Growth factor imbalance and calcium overload promote lysosome based degradation whereas calcium deficit promotes proteasome based degradation, in both cases myofibrillar and mitochondrial morphologies are largely unaffected.

The level of H69 cleavage increases with the bacterial exposure time, and it is predominantly localized in the worm's intestinal tissue. Genetic and genomic analysis suggests that H69 cleavage leads to the activation of the worm's zip-2-mediated defense response pathway, consistent with translational inhibition. Taken together, our observations suggest that P. aeruginosa deploys a virulence mechanism to induce ribosome degradation and H69 cleavage of host ribosomes. In this manner, P. aeruginosa would impair host translation and block antibacterial responses.\",\n",

Here, we demonstrate the induction of MAPK<sup>mt</sup> in worms deficient in the <i>lonp-1</i> gene, which encodes the worm ortholog of mammalian mitochondrial LonP1. This induction is subjected to negative regulation by the ATFS-1 transcription factor through the CREB-binding protein (CBP) ortholog CBP-3, indicating an interplay between both activated MAPK<sup>mt</sup> and mitochondrial Unfolded Protein Response (UPR<sup>mt</sup>) surveillance pathways. Our results also reveal a genetic interaction in <i>lonp-1</i> mutants between PMK-3 kinase and the ZIP-2 transcription factor. ZIP-2 has an established role in innate immunity but can also modulate the lifespan by maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis during ageing. We show that in <i>lonp-1</i> animals, ZIP-2 is activated in a PMK-3-dependent manner but does not confer increased survival to pathogenic bacteria. However, deletion of <i>zip-2</i> or <i>pmk-3</i> shortens the lifespan of <i>lonp-1</i> mutants, suggesting a possible crosstalk under conditions of mitochondrial perturbation that influences the ageing process. Furthermore, loss of <i>pmk-3</i> specifically diminished the extreme heat tolerance of <i>lonp-1</i> worms, highlighting the crucial role of PMK-3 in the heat shock response upon mitochondrial LONP-1 inactivation.\",\n",

A wide variety of stresses, including hypoxia, heat, and infection by pathogens perpetually threaten to imbalance this state. Organisms use a battery of defenses to mitigate damage and restore normal function.

Although pyoverdine is also indispensable for virulence in mammals, its cytological effects are unclear. We used genetics, transcriptomics, and a variety of pathogen and chemical exposure assays to study the interactions between P. aeruginosa and C. elegans. Although P. aeruginosa can kill C. elegans through at least 5 different mechanisms, the defense responses activated by Liquid Killing are specific and selective and have little in common with innate defense mechanisms against intestinal colonization. Intriguingly, the defense response utilizes the phylogenetically-conserved ESRE (Ethanol and Stress Response Element) network, which we and others have previously shown mitigates damage from a variety of abiotic stresses. This is the first report of this network's involvement in innate immunity, and indicates that host innate immune responses overlap with responses to abiotic stresses. The upregulation of the ESRE network in C. elegans is mediated in part by a family of bZIP proteins (including ZIP-2, ZIP-4, CEBP-1, and CEBP-2) that have overlapping and unique functions. Our data convincingly show that, following infection by P. aeruginosa, the ESRE defense network is activated by mitochondrial damage, and that mitochondrial damage also leads to ESRE activation in mammals. This establishes a role for ESRE in a phylogenetically-conserved mitochondrial surveillance system important for stress response and innate immunity.\",\n",

The epoxygenase and hydroxylase reactions were NADPH-dependent, required the functional expression of the CPR-encoding emb-8 gene, and were inhibited by 17-ODYA and PPOH, two compounds known to inactivate mammalian AA-metabolizing CYP isoforms. Multiple followed by single RNAi gene silencing experiments identified CYP-29A3 and CYP-33E2 as the major isoforms contributing to EPA metabolism in C. elegans. Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry revealed that regioisomeric epoxy- and hydroxy-derivatives of EPA and AA are endogenous constituents of C. elegans. The endogenous EPA metabolite levels were increased by treating the worms with fenofibrate, which also induced the microsomal epoxygenase and hydroxylase activities. These results demonstrate for the first time that C. elegans shares with mammals the capacity to produce CYP-dependent eicosanoids and may thus facilitate future studies on the mechanisms of action of this important class of signaling molecules.\",\n",

Over the last decade, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has become a popular animal model for exploring the regulation of lipid metabolism, obesity, and obese-related diseases. However, the genomic and functional conservation of lipid metabolism from C. elegans to humans remains unknown. In the present study, we systematically analyzed genes involved in lipid metabolism in the C. elegans genome using comparative genomics. RESULTS: We built a database containing 471 lipid genes from the C. elegans genome, and then assigned most of lipid genes into 16 different lipid metabolic pathways that were integrated into a network. Over 70% of C. elegans lipid genes have human orthologs, with 237 of 471 C. elegans lipid genes being conserved in humans, mice, rats, and Drosophila, of which 71 genes are specifically related to human metabolic diseases. Moreover, RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) was used to disrupt the expression of 356 of 471 lipid genes with available RNAi clones. We found that 21 genes strongly affect fat storage, development, reproduction, and other visible phenotypes, 6 of which have not previously been implicated in the regulation of fat metabolism and other phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first systematic genomic insight into lipid metabolism in C. elegans, supporting the use of C. elegans as an increasingly prominent model in the study of metabolic diseases.\",\n",

Dietary restriction (DR), which positively affects health and life span across species, leads to metabolic reprogramming that enhances utilisation of fatty acids for energy generation. One direct consequence of this metabolic shift is the upregulation of cytoprotective (CyTP) genes categorized in the Gene Ontology (GO) term of &quot;Xenobiotic Detoxification Program&quot; (XDP). How an organism senses metabolic changes during nutritional stress to alter gene expression programs is less known. Here, using a genetic model of DR, we show that the levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially linoleic acid (LA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), are increased following DR and these PUFAs are able to activate the CyTP genes. This activation of CyTP genes is mediated by the conserved p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38-MAPK) pathway. Consequently, genes of the PUFA biosynthesis and p38-MAPK pathway are required for multiple paradigms of DR-mediated longevity, suggesting conservation of mechanism. Thus, our study shows that PUFAs and p38-MAPK pathway function downstream of DR to help communicate the metabolic state of an organism to regulate expression of CyTP genes, ensuring extended life span.\",\n",

High environmental osmolarity reduces internal turgor pressure, physically distorts the epidermis, and activates the same stress responses. Collagen gene mutations that that cause Dumpy without furrow disruption do not activate stress responses. These results are consistent with an extracellular damage sensor associated with furrows in the adult cuticle that regulates environmental stress responses in adjacent cells. Several cuticle characteristics change between molts, but all stages have annular furrows and express furrow collagen genes. We compared body shape, furrow organization imaged with DIC microscopy, and stress response gene expression in three furrow collagen gene mutants at all post-embryonic stages. We find that most body shape and furrow disorganization phenotypes start at the L3 stage and increase in severity with each molt afterwards. Stress response genes were induced the strongest in adults, correlating with the greatest Dumpy and furrow phenotypes. Although weaker than in adults, osmolyte transporter gene hmit-1.1 and antimicrobial gene nlp-29 were also induced in some early larvae that had weak or undetectable cuticle phenotypes. Our data are consistent with progressive cuticle phenotypes in which each new cuticle is at least partially directed by organization of the former cuticle.

Intervention with RE alleviated aging-related declines in the C. elegans model, and enhanced the stress resistance against heat shock, ultraviolet radiation and paraquat. Moreover, RE reduced the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) and increased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). RE also upregulated the gene expression of sod-3, gst-4, daf-16, skn-1 in C. elegans, downregulated the gene expression of daf-2 and age-1, and accelerated the translocation of DAF-16 and SKN-1 into the nucleus. Furthermore, the daf-16(mu86) and skn-1(zu169) mutants reversed the extension of lifespan triggered by RE, indicating that these genes were involved in RE-regulated longevity.

Here we show that despite its distinct mode of target gene recognition, SKN-1 functions similarly to resist oxidative stress in C. elegans. During postembryonic stages, SKN-1 regulates a key Phase II detoxification gene through constitutive and stress-inducible mechanisms in the ASI chemosensory neurons and intestine, respectively. SKN-1 is present in ASI nuclei under normal conditions, and accumulates in intestinal nuclei in response to oxidative stress. skn-1 mutants are sensitive to oxidative stress and have shortened lifespans. SKN-1 represents a connection between developmental specification of the digestive system and one of its most basic functions, resistance to oxidative and xenobiotic stress. This oxidative stress response thus appears to be both widely conserved and ancient, suggesting that the mesendodermal specification role of SKN-1 was predated by its function in these detoxification mechanisms.\",\n",

We assessed aspirin effects on endogenous oxidative-stress levels, lifespan, and age-related functional declines, in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. RESULTS: Both aspirin and its salicylate moiety, at nontoxic concentrations (0.5-1mM), attenuated endogenous levels of reactive oxygen species (p&lt;0.001), and upregulated antioxidant genes encoding superoxide dismutases (especially sod-3, p&lt;0.001), catalases (especially ctl-2, p&lt;0.0001), and two glutathione-S-transferases (gst-4 and gst-10; each p&lt;0.005). Aspirin, and to a lesser degree salicylate, improved survival of hydrogen peroxide, and in the absence of exogenous stress aspirin extended lifespan by 21%-23% (each p&lt;10(-9)), while salicylate added 14% (p&lt;10(-6)). Aspirin and salicylate delayed age-dependent declines in motility and pharyngeal pumping (each p&lt;0.005), and decreased intracellular protein aggregation (p&lt;0.0001)-all established markers of physiological aging-consistent with slowing of the aging process. Aspirin fails to improve stress resistance or lifespan in nematodes lacking DAF-16, implying that it acts through this FOXO transcription factor. INNOVATION: Studies in mice and humans suggest that aspirin may protect against multiple age-associated diseases by reducing all-cause mortality. We now demonstrate that aspirin markedly slows many measures of aging in the nematode. CONCLUSIONS: Aspirin treatment is associated with diminished endogenous oxidant stress and enhanced resistance to exogenous peroxide, both likely mediated by activation of antioxidant defenses.

Genetic analysis in C. elegans nematodes has shown that DR and IIS couple to distinct cellular signaling pathways.

PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated this question by examining additional effects of DR in wildtype animals and in daf-2 mutants with either moderate or severe IIS deficits. Surprisingly, DR and IIS had opposing effects on these physiological processes. First, DR induced a stress-related change in intestinal vesicle trafficking, termed the FIRE response, which was suppressed in daf-2 mutants. Second, DR did not strongly affect expression of a daf-2- and stress-responsive transcriptional reporter. Finally, DR-related growth impairment was suppressed in daf-2 mutants. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal that an important biological function of DAF-2/IIS is to enhance growth and survival under nutrient-limited conditions. However, we also discovered that levels of DAF-2 pathway activity modified the effects of DR on longevity. Thus, while DR and IIS clearly affect lifespan through independent targets, there may also be some prolongevity targets that are convergently regulated by these pathways.\",\n",

METHODS: Survival rate in mutant daf-16 and skn-1 worms, stressed by the pro-oxidant juglone and treated with the extract, was tested. Localization of the transcription factors SKN-1 and DAF-16, and expression of gst-4 were measured. For evaluation of neuroprotective effects, formation of polyglutamine (polyQ40) clusters, &#x3b1;-synuclein aggregates, loss of amphid sensilla (ASH) neuronal function, and amyloid &#x3b2; (A&#x3b2;) accumulation (as markers for Huntington's, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's) was examined.

We analyzed the toxicity of these two phthalates using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model system. Gene expression analysis following exposure during the L1 to young adult stage showed that DEHP and DEP alter the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism and stress response. Genes associated with lipid metabolism, including fasn-1, pod-2, fat-5, acs-6 and sbp-1, and vitellogenin were upregulated.

Lipid staining revealed that DEHP significantly increased lipid content following 1M exposure, however, DEP required 10M exposure to elicit an effect. Both DEHP and DEP reduced the fecundity at 1M concentration. Lifespan analysis indicated that DEHP and DEP reduced the average lifespan from 14 days in unexposed worms to 13 and 12 days, respectively. Expression of lifespan associated genes showed a correlation to shortened lifespan in the exposed groups. As reported previously, our data also indicates that the banned DEHP is toxic to C.elegans, however its substitute DEP has not been previously tested in this model organism and our data revealed that DEP is equally potent as DEHP in regulating C.elegans physiological functions.\",\n",

We hypothesized that EGCG could induce a Nrf2-mediated protective response to antagonize MeHg toxicity. Using the Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) nematode model, we observed that EGCG activated SKN-1 (the functional ortholog of Nrf2 in C. elegans), as shown by the increased skn-1 mRNA level, induction of the gene gst-4, and enhanced SKN-1-mediated oxidative stress resistance that were indicated by elevation of total antioxidant ability and reductions in reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde. Following exposure to MeHg, EGCG-treated C. elegans displayed increased survival rates, improved locomotion behaviors, decreased numbers of damaged neurons, and reduced oxidative damage compared to the controls. Moreover, the protective effects of EGCG against MeHg toxicity were counteracted by RNA-mediated interference of skn-1. These results demonstrated that EGCG could alleviate MeHg toxicity by upregulating the SKN-1-regulated protective response in C. elegans.

Consequently, the latent transcription factor Nrf2 is stabilized and translocates into the nucleus, where it transactivates the expression of detoxification genes through binding to the antioxidant response element (ARE). In the pursuit of potent and bioavailable activators of the ARE, we validated hits from a pathway-directed high-throughput screening campaign by testing them in cell culture and a reporter strain of a whole animal model, Caenorhabditis elegans. These studies allowed us to identify AI-3 as an ARE activator that induces cytoprotective genes in human cells and in worms, which also translated into in vivo activity in mice. AI-3 is an electrophilic ARE activator with two thiol sensitive sites toward a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, and SAR studies indicated the tunability of the system. Tandem LC-MS analysis revealed that AI-3 alkylates Keap1 primarily at Cys151, while AI-3 is reactive toward additional cysteine residues at higher doses in vitro and in vivo. The immediate effects of such alkylation included the disruption of Keap1-Cul3 (low [AI-3]) and/or Keap1-Nrf2 (high [AI-3]) interactions that both led to the stabilization of Nrf2. This further translated into the downstream Nrf2-ARE regulated cytoprotective gene activation.

In addition, ruthenium(II) complexes (2-4) also exhibited an excellent invivo antioxidant activity as it was able to increase the survival of worms exposed to lethal oxidative and thermal stresses possibly through reducing the intracellular ROS levels. It was interesting to note that complexes 2-4 failed to increase the lifespan of mev-1 mutant worms having shortened lifespan due to the over production of free radicals. This data confirmed that complexes 2-4 conferred stress resistance in C.elegans, but they also require an endogenous detoxification mechanism for doing so. The genetic and reporter gene expression analysis revealed that complexes 2-4 maintained the intracellular redox status and offered stress protection through transactivation of antioxidant defence machinery genes gst-4 and sod-3 which are directly regulated by SKN-1 and DAF-16 transcription factors, respectively. Altogether, our results suggested that complexes 2-4 might play a crucial role in stress modulation and they perhaps exert almost similar effects in higher models, which is an important issue to be validated in future.\",\n",

N-terminal acetylation is a widespread modification of eukaryotic proteins; however, relatively little is known about the biological functions of NATs. We demonstrated that loss-of-function mutations in natc-1 cause resistance to a broad-spectrum of physiologic stressors, including multiple metals, heat, and oxidation. The C. elegans FOXO transcription factor DAF-16 is a critical target of the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway that mediates stress resistance, and DAF-16 is predicted to directly bind the natc-1 promoter. To characterize the regulation of natc-1 by DAF-16 and the function of natc-1 in insulin/IGF-1 signaling, we analyzed molecular and genetic interactions with key components of the insulin/IGF-1 pathway. natc-1 mRNA levels were repressed by DAF-16 activity, indicating natc-1 is a physiological target of DAF-16. Genetic studies suggested that natc-1 functions downstream of daf-16 to mediate stress resistance and dauer formation. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that natc-1 is directly regulated by the DAF-16 transcription factor, and natc-1 is a physiologically significant effector of the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway that mediates stress resistance and dauer formation. These studies identify a novel biological function for natc-1 as a modulator of stress resistance and dauer formation and define a functionally significant downstream effector of the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway.

The data were interpreted to suggest that exogenous lipophilic compounds can be metabolized via cytochrome P450 proteins, and that the resulting metabolites can bind to members of the Nuclear Receptor (NR) class of proteins and regulate gene expression. In the present study, using DNA microarrays, we examined the pattern of gene expression after progesterone (10(-5), 10(-7) M), estradiol (10-5 M), cholesterol (10(-9) M) and cadmium (0.1, 1 and 10 &#956; M) exposure, with special attention to the members of NRs. Of approximately 284 NRs in C. elegans, expression of 25 NR genes (representing 9% of the total NRs in C elegans) was altered after exposure to steroids. Of note, each steroid activated or inhibited different subsets of NR genes, and only estradiol regulated NR genes implicated in neurogenesis. These results suggest that NRs respond to a variety of exogenous steroids, which regulate important metabolic and developmental pathways. The response of the C elegans genome to cholesterol and cadmium was analyzed in more detail. Cholesterol is a probable precursor to signaling molecules that may interact with NRs and we focused on expression of genes related to lipid metabolism (cyp450), transport and storage (Le., vitellogenin). Worms exposed to cadmium respond principally by activating the expression of genes encoding stress-responsive proteins, such as mtl-2 and cdr-1, and no significant changes in expression of NRs or vtg genes were observed.

The results indicate that genistein substantially extended the lifespan of C. elegans under oxidative stress and heat conditions; and remarkably reduced the accumulation of lipofuscin in C. elegans under hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and 35 C stress conditions; in addition, it reduced the generation of ROS caused by H2O2 and upregulated the expression of daf-16, ctl-1, hsf-1, hsp-16.2, sip-1, sek-1, pmk-1, and eat-2, whereas it downregulated the expression of age-1 and daf-2 in C. elegans; similarly, it upregulated the expression of daf-16, sod-3, ctl-1, hsf-1, hsp-16.2, sip-1, sek-1, pmk-1, jnk-1 skn-1, and eat-2, whereas it downregulated the expression of age-1, daf-2, gst-4, and hsp-12.6 in C. elegans at 35 C; moreover, it increased the accumulation of HSP-16.2 and SKN-1 proteins in nematodes under 35 C and H2O2 conditions; however, it failed to prolong the survival time in the deleted mutant MQ130 nematodes under 35 C and H2O2 conditions. These results suggest that genistein promote anti-heat stress and antioxidant effects in C. elegans via insulin/-insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS), heat shock protein (HSP), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), dietary restriction (DR), and mitochondrial pathways.\",\n",

Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model, SW was found to enhance neurotransmission by modulating AChE and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) activity; being orchestrated through up-regulation of unc-17 and unc-50. SW exhibited AChE inhibition both in vivo and cell-free system. The in silico molecular docking of SW and human AChE (hAChE) displayed good binding energy of -6.02. Interestingly, the increase in aldicarb and levamisole sensitivity post SW treatment was curtailed to a significant level in daf-16 and skn-1 mutants. SW raised the level of the endogenous antioxidant enzymes through up-regulation of sod-3 and gst-4 that act downstream to DAF-16 and SKN-1, imparting protection against neurodegeneration. The outcome of our study displays SW as a potential natural molecule for the amelioration of cholinergic dysfunction. Moreover, the study also indicates that SW elicits antioxidant response via up-modulation of daf-16 possibly through unc-17 upregulation.

In this work, we describe a microfluidic assay to model type 2 diabetes-like hyperglycemia in C. elegans to examine several aspects of this disease on a microdevice. The microdevice is characterized by the integration of long-term worm culture, worm immobilization, and precise chemical stimuli in a single device, thus enabling the multi-parameter analysis of individual worms at a single-animal resolution. With this device, the lifespan, oxidative stress responses, and lipid metabolism of individual worms in response to different glucose concentrations were characterized. It was found that the mean lifespan of worms was significantly reduced by as much as 29.0% and 30.8% in worms that were subjected to 100 mM and 200 mM glucose, respectively. The expression of oxidative stress protein gst-4 was increased, and the expression of hsp-70 (heat shock protein) and skn-1 (redox sensitive transcription factor) genes was down-regulated in worms treated with a high level of glucose. Moreover, fat storage was markedly increased in the bodies of VS29 worms (vha-6p::GFP::dgat-2) that were exposed to the high-glucose condition.

SKN-1/Nrf are activated by a remarkably broad-range of natural and synthetic compounds and physiological conditions. Defining the signaling mechanisms that regulate SKN-1/Nrf activation provides insights into how cells coordinate responses to stress. Nrf2 in mammals is regulated in part by the redox sensor repressor protein named Keap1. In C. elegans, the p38 MAPK cascade in the intestine activates SKN-1 during oxidative stress by promoting its nuclear accumulation. Interestingly, we find variation in the kinetics of p38 MAPK activation and tissues with SKN-1 nuclear accumulation among different pro-oxidants that all trigger strong induction of SKN-1 target genes. Using genome-wide RNAi screening, we identify new genes that are required for activation of the core SKN-1 target gene gst-4 during exposure to the natural pro-oxidant juglone. Among 10 putative activators identified in this screen was skr-1/2, highly conserved homologs of yeast and mammalian Skp1, which function to assemble protein complexes. Silencing of skr-1/2 inhibits induction of SKN-1 dependent detoxification genes and reduces resistance to pro-oxidants without decreasing p38 MAPK activation. Global transcriptomics revealed strong correlation between genes that are regulated by SKR-1/2 and SKN-1 indicating a high degree of specificity. We also show that SKR-1/2 functions upstream of the WD40 repeat protein WDR-23, which binds to and inhibits SKN-1.

PURPOSE: We aimed to provide the first science-based evidence of the beneficial effects of GZ on anti-aging and oxidative stress resistance in the Caenorhabditis elegans model. METHODS: The phytochemical composition of the hexane and methanol extracts were analyzed using GLC-MS and LC-MS. Fingerprinting analysis of the extract was performed by RP-HPLC. We determined total phenolics, flavonoids, and antioxidant properties via DPPH and ABTS assays. Oxidative stress resistance, anti-aging and lifespan were studied in C. elegans treated with leaf extracts. RESULTS: GZ leaf extracts protected the worms against oxidative stress and attenuated ROS accumulation. The expression of stress-response genes, such as SOD-3, and GST-4 were up-regulated, whereas HSP-16.2 was down-regulated after GZ treatment. The oxidative stress resistance properties of GZ possibly involved the DAF-16/FoxO and SKN-1/Nrf-2 transcription factors. GZ leaf extracts improved pharyngeal pumping function and autofluorescent pigment attenuation suggesting anti-aging properties. GZ leaf extracts modulated the lifespan extension in C. elegans.

Treatment of gst-4 reporter strain (CL2166) with increasing concentrations of ASSNAC (0.2 to 20 mM) for 24 hours and with ASSNAC (10 mM) for various time periods demonstrated a significant concentration- and time-dependent increase in Glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene expression (up to 60-fold at 20 mM after 24 hours).

This allowed for the temporal and spatial reduction in DAF-2 protein levels at time points after which interventions such as RNAi become ineffective. Using this system, we found that AID-mediated depletion of DAF-2 protein surpasses the longevity of daf-2 mutants. Depletion of DAF-2 during early adulthood resulted in multiple adverse phenotypes, including growth retardation, germline shrinkage, egg retention, and reduced brood size. By contrast, AID-mediated depletion of DAF-2 post reproduction, or specifically in the intestine in early adulthood, resulted in an extension of lifespan without these deleterious effects. Strikingly, at geriatric ages, when 75% of the population had died, AID-mediated depletion of DAF-2 protein resulted in a doubling in lifespan. Thus, we provide a proof-of-concept that even close to the end of an individual's lifespan, it is possible to slow aging and promote longevity.\",\n",

Of the 21,120 genes profiled, 409 genes were more than two-fold upregulated and 111 genes were downregulated. Upregulated genes included many that encode detoxification enzymes such as glutathione S-transferases (GST), UDP-glucuronosyl/glucosyl transferases (UGT), and short-chain type dehydrogenases (SDR) but only one cytochrome P450 (CYP). Subsequent proteomic analysis confirmed the heavy involvement of GSTs. Because of their high expression levels and central roles in acrylamide metabolism, we analyzed the in vivo expression patterns of eight gst genes. Although all encoded GST and were more than two-fold upregulated by acrylamide treatment, their expression patterns were varied, and their regulation involved the transcription factor SKN-1 (a C. elegans homologue of Nrf1/2). We then selected the gst4::gfp-transformed C. elegans to study the detoxification rate of acrylamide and its metabolite glycidimide in living animals. This animal detects acrylamide as a GFP-expression signal in a dose- and time-dependent manner and may prove to be a useful tool not only for rapidly and inexpensively detecting acrylamide, a harmful substance in food, but also for analyzing mechanisms of GST induction by acrylamide and other inducers like oxidative stresses.\",\n",

In this study, we utilize an acute toxicity model of MeHg exposure in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) to compare lifespan, developmental progression, mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species (ROS) between the wild-type N2 strain, wild-type LRRK2 transgenic strain (WLZ1), and mutant LRRK2(G2019S) transgenic strain (WLZ3). Additionally, the expression levels of skn-1 and gst-4 were investigated. Our results show that acute MeHg exposure (5 and 10M) caused a significant developmental delay in the N2 and WLZ3 worms. Notably, the worms expressing wild-type LRRK2 were resistant to 5M MeHg- induced developmental retardation. ROS levels in response to MeHg exposure were increased in the N2 worms, but not in the WLZ1 or WLZ3 worms. The mitochondrial membrane potential was decreased in the N2 worms but increased in the WLZ1 and WLZ3 worms following MeHg exposure. Furthermore, MeHg exposure increased the expression of skn-1 in N2, but not in WLZ1 worms.

Both skn-1 and gst-4 had higher basal expression levels in LRRK2s transgenic than wild-type N2 worms. Knocking down of skn-1 with feeding RNAi had a significant developmental effect in WLZ1 worms; however, the effect was not found in WLZ3 worms. These results suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction and a defect in the SKN-1 signaling in the LRRK2 G2019S worms contribute to the severe developmental delay, establishing a modulatory role of LRRK2 mutation in MeHg-induced acute toxicity.\",\n",

To maintain energy-consuming processes in OXPHOS deficient cells, alternative metabolic pathways are functionally coupled to the degradation, recycling and redistribution of biomolecules across distinct intracellular compartments. While transcriptional regulation of mitochondrial network expansion has been the focus of many studies, the molecular mechanisms promoting mitochondrial maintenance in energy-deprived cells remain poorly investigated. METHODS: We performed transcriptomics, quantitative proteomics and lifespan assays to identify pathways that are mechanistically linked to mitochondrial network expansion and homeostasis in Caenorhabditis elegans lacking the mitochondrial calcium uptake protein 1 (MICU-1/MICU1). To support our findings, we carried out biochemical and image analyses in mammalian cells and mouse-derived tissues. RESULTS: We report that micu-1(null) mutations impair the OXPHOS system and promote C. elegans longevity through a transcriptional program that is independent of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter MCU-1/MCU and the essential MCU regulator EMRE-1/EMRE. We identify sphingosine phosphate lyase SPL-1/SGPL1 and the ATFS-1-target HOPS complex subunit VPS-39/VPS39 as critical lifespan modulators of micu-1(null) mutant animals. Cross-species investigation indicates that SGPL1 upregulation stimulates VPS39 recruitment to the mitochondria, thereby enhancing mitochondria-lysosome contacts. Consistently, VPS39 downregulation compromises mitochondrial network maintenance and basal autophagic flux in MICU1 deficient cells. In mouse-derived muscles, we show that VPS39 recruitment to the mitochondria may represent a common signature associated with altered OXPHOS system.

We investigated monascin to test whether this compound acts as an antidiabetic and antioxidative stress agent in diabetic rats and Caenorhabditis elegans. The mechanisms by which monascin exerts its action in vivo were also examined. Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats were given monascin at 30 mg/kg/day and sacrificed after 8 weeks. Blood glucose and serum insulin, triglyceride, total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein and antioxidative enzymes in the pancreas of rats were measured. In addition, monascin was evaluated for stress resistance and potential associated mechanisms in C. elegans. Throughout the 8-week experimental period, significantly lowered blood glucose, serum triglyceride, and total cholesterol and higher high-density lipoprotein levels were observed in monascin-treated rats. Monascin-treated rats showed higher serum insulin level, lower reactive oxygen species production, and higher activities of glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase in the pancreas compared to diabetic control rats. In addition, monascin significantly induced the hepatic mRNA levels of FOXO3a, FOXO1, MnSOD, and catalase in STZ-induced diabetic rats. Monascin-treated C. elegans showed an increased survival rate during oxidative stress and heat stress treatments compared to untreated controls. Moreover, monascin extended the life span under high-glucose conditions and enhanced expression of small heat shock protein (sHSP-16.2), superoxide dismutase (SOD-3), and glutathione S-transferase (GST-4) in C. elegans. Finally, we showed that monascin affected the subcellular distribution of the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16, whereas it was unable to enhance oxidative stress resistance in the daf-16 deletion mutant in C. elegans. Mechanistic studies in rats and C. elegans suggest that the protective effects of monascin are mediated via regulation of the FOXO/DAF-16-dependent insulin signaling pathway by inducing the expression of stress response/antioxidant genes, thereby enhancing oxidative stress resistance.\",\n",

Graphene oxide (GO) has been proven to cause potential toxicity on organisms. However, the molecular mechanisms for intestinal barrier of animals against GO toxicity are largely unclear. Using in vivo assay system of Caenorhabditis elegans, we found that mutation of genes encoding core p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway caused susceptible property to GO toxicity and enhanced translocation of GO into the body of nematodes. Genetic assays indicated that SKN-1/Nrf functioned downstream of p38 MAPK signaling pathway to regulate GO toxicity and translocation. Transcription factor of SKN-1 could regulate GO toxicity and translocation at least through function of its targeted gene of gst-4 encoding one of phase II detoxification proteins. Moreover, intestine-specific RNA interference (RNAi) assay demonstrated that the p38 MAPK-SKN-1/Nrf signaling cascade could function in intestine to regulate GO toxicity and intestinal permeability in GO exposed nematodes. Therefore, p38 MAPK-SKN-1/Nrf signaling cascade may act as an important molecular basis for intestinal barrier against GO toxicity in organisms. Exposure to GO induced significantly increased expression of genes encoding p38 MAPK-SKN-1/Nrf signaling cascade, which further implies that the identified p38 MAPK-SKN-1/Nrf signaling cascade may encode a protection mechanism for nematodes in intestine to be against GO toxicity.\",\n",

In recent years, AX had been shown to have anti-aging properties, both in vivo and in vitro. However, the underlying mechanisms by which AX regulates senescence related proteins and signaling pathways remain unclear. Therefore, we used Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) model binding proteomics to reveal AX anti-aging activity and its molecular mechanism. Our results suggest that AX promotes the health and lifespan of C. elegans by improving mobility, reducing the accumulation of age pigments, and increasing resistance to heat stress. In terms of the underlying mechanism, AX helps prolong the life of worms by regulating AGE-1 in the insulin signaling pathway, promoting the transport of DAF-16 into the nucleus and then up-regulating the expression level of DAF-16's downstream proteins (such as superoxide dismutase [Mn] 2 (SOD-3), heat shock proteins (HSPs), glutathione s-transferase (GST-4), etc.). Furthermore, AX may be a relevant response target for activation of dietary restriction pathways in vivo as a dietary restriction mimic. Meanwhile, proteomics data confirmed that there were 15 proteins enriched in the longevity regulation pathway. AX mainly regulates oxidative stress and the aging process by modulating the insulin signaling pathway around DAF-16 as the \\\"hub\\\". In addition to the insulin signaling pathway, other pathways including dietary restriction, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and mammal target of rapamycin (mTOR) are also dependent on DAF-16. These findings expand and deepen our knowledge of the underlying mechanism by which AX extends the lifespan of C. elegans.\",\n",

SKN-1A/Nrf1, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated transcription factor that undergoes N-linked glycosylation, serves as a sensor of proteasome dysfunction and triggers compensatory upregulation of proteasome subunit genes. Here, we show that the PNG-1/NGLY1 peptide:N-glycanase edits the sequence of SKN-1A protein by converting particular N-glycosylated asparagine residues to aspartic acid. Genetically introducing aspartates at these N-glycosylation sites bypasses the requirement for PNG-1/NGLY1, showing that protein sequence editing rather than deglycosylation is key to SKN-1A function. This pathway is required to maintain sufficient proteasome expression and activity, and SKN-1A hyperactivation confers resistance to the proteotoxicity of human amyloid beta peptide. Deglycosylation-dependent protein sequence editing explains how ER-associated and cytosolic isoforms of SKN-1 perform distinct cytoprotective functions corresponding to those of mammalian Nrf1 and Nrf2.

They are assumed to exert beneficial effects but the precise biological mechanism of their action is unknown. In this project, we studied effects of the flavonoids quercetin and rutin in the multicellular model organism Caenorhabditis elegans that exhibits a strong conservation in molecular and cellular pathways to mammals. Both flavonoids reduced the ROS accumulation at thermal stress and the extent of induced oxidative stress with quercetin having a stronger impact. The higher antioxidative activity of quercetin may explain the protection against lethal thermal stress and the reduction in accumulation of the ageing marker lipofuscin exerted by quercetin but not by rutin. The subcellular distribution of the FoxO transcription factor DAF-16 was only affected by quercetin indicating a modulatory effect of quercetin on signalling cascade(s).

The present study aims at testing both the antioxidant and neuroprotective effects of a hydroalcoholic extract from the aerial parts of Cassia fistula using the Caenorhabditis elegans model, which is widely used in this context. METHODS: Chemical profiling of secondary metabolites that seem to be responsible for both antioxidant and neuroprotective capacities was carried out by HPLC/PDA/ESI-MSn. Antioxidant activity was tested in vitro by CUPRAC and DPPH assays. In vivo antioxidant and neuroprotective activities were investigated using the C. elegans model. RESULTS: The Cassia extract improved the survival rate of the nematodes and protected them against oxidative stress. In addition, a decrease in the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was observed. The important role of DAF-16/FOXO pathway was confirmed through an increased nuclear localization of the DAF-16 transcription factor, increased expression of SOD-3 stress response gene and decreased expression of HSP-16.2. Furthermore, the putative involvement of SKN-1/NRF2 pathway was demonstrated by a decrease in GST-4 levels. A neuroprotective activity of the Cassia extract was shown by a decline in polyglutamine (polyQ40) aggregate formation and a delay in paralysis caused by amyloid beta (A&#946;1-42) accumulation. DISCUSSION: The Cassia extract exhibits substantial antioxidant and neuroprotective activities in vivo, which might provide a rich and novel source of natural antioxidants and neuroprotective compounds to be further studied for the use in various food and cosmetic industrial fields.\",\n",

The 48-h median lethal concentrations (LC<sub>50</sub>) for PFOS and PFBS were 1.4M (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-1.6) and 794M (95% CI: 624-1009), respectively.

Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) offers a unique biological model to explore mechanisms of MeHg toxicity given many advantages associated with its ease of use and genetic power. Since our previous work indicated neurotoxic resistance of C. elegans to MeHg, the present study was designed to examine molecular mechanisms associated with this resistance. We hypothesized MeHg would induce expression of gst, hsp or mtl in vivo since glutathione (GSH), heat shock proteins (HSPs), and metallothioneins (MTs) have shown involvement in MeHg toxicity. Our studies demonstrated a modest, but significant increase in fluorescence in gst-4::GFP and mtl-1::GFP strains at an acute, low L1 MeHg exposure, whereas chronic L4 MeHg exposure induced expression of gst-4::GFP and hsp-4::GFP. Knockout gst-4 animals showed no alterations in lethality sensitivity compared to wildtype animals whereas mtl knockouts displayed increased sensitivity to MeHg exposure. GSH levels were increased by acute MeHg treatment and depleted with chronic exposure. We also demonstrate that MeHg induces hormesis, a phenotype whereby a sublethal exposure to MeHg rendered C. elegans resistant to subsequent exposure to the organometal. The involvement of gst-4, hsp-4, mtl-1, and mtl-2 in hormesis was examined. An increase in gst-4::GFP expression after a low-dose acute exposure to MeHg indicated that gst-4 may be involved in this response. Our results implicate GSH, HSPs, and MTs in protecting C. elegans from MeHg toxicity and show a potential role of gst-4 in MeHg-induced hormesis.\",\n",

In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the nuclear receptor DAF-12 acts as a dietary and environmental sensor to orchestrate diverse aspects of development, metabolism, and reproduction. Recently, we have reported that DAF-12 together with co-repressor DIN-1S is required for starvation tolerance by promoting fat mobilization. In this report, we found that genetic inactivation of the DAF-12 signaling promoted the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during starvation. ROS mediated systemic necrosis, thereby inducing organismal death. The DAF-12/DIN-1S complex up-regulated the expression of antioxidant genes during starvation. The antioxidant enzyme GST-4 in turn suppressed ROS formation, thereby conferring worm survival. Our findings highlight the importance of antioxidant response in starvation tolerance and provide a novel insight into multiple organisms survive and adapt to periods of nutrient deprivation.\",\n",

Previously, antidiabetic drug metformin was found to elicit antiaging effects and PHE was also found to exhibit antidiabetic effects in humans. Therefore, we screened it for its in vivo antioxidant antiaging effect on stress and lifespan using human homologous Caenorhabditis elegans model system. The effect on aging is evaluated by studying effect of PHE on mean survival in worms. The stress modulatory potential was assessed by quantification of intracellular ROS level, autofluorescent age pigment lipofuscin, oxidative and thermal stress assays. Additionally, stress response was quantified using gene reporter assays. The 0.01g/ml dose of PHE was able to enhance mean lifespan by 16.09% (P&lt;0.0001) in C. elegans. Furthermore, PHE treated worms demonstrated oxidative stress resistance in both wild type and stress hypersensitive mev-1 mutant along with upregulation of stress response genes sod-3 and gst-4.

The localization of both transgenes was similar to that of native CeGSTP2-2. The 4-HNE-conjugating activity in worm lysates increased in the order: control &lt; mGsta4 transgenic &lt; gst-10 transgenic; and the amount of 4-HNE-protein adducts decreased in the same order, indicating that the transgenic enzymes were active and effective in limiting electrophilic damage by 4-HNE.

Resistance to paraquat, heat shock, ultraviolet irradiation and hydrogen peroxide was greater in transgenic strains. Median lifespan of mGsta4 and gst-10 transgenic strains vs. control strains was increased by 13% and 22%, respectively.

Approximately 30% of all human cancers relevant to mutational activated Ras, and over-activated Ras are accompanied by increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Thus, one way of developing anticancer drugs is to reduce ROS accumulation. Therefore, KR was predicted to have potential to combat over-activated Ras-related cancer. C.elegans with let60(gf)/ras mutant, which exhibited tumor-like symptoms of the multivulva phenotype, was employed to determine the effect of KR on Ras/MAPK pathway. Other strains of worms and H2DCF-DA dye were also applied to study the antioxidant stress capacity of KR. This study was aimed to determine whether KR has a potential effect on combat over-activated Ras-related cancer through resistance to oxidative stress. Our results showed that Kushui rose decoction (KRD) has potent antioxidant activity invitro, and can inhibit over-activated Ras invivo. Further, KRD significantly suppressed over-activated Ras/MAPK pathway by regulating oxidative stress-related proteins, such as forkhead transcription factor (DAF-16), glutathione S-transferase-4 (GST-4), superoxide dismutases(SODs) and heat shock protein-16.2(HSP-16.2). However, essential oil and hydrosol of KR had no effect on over-activated Ras. Thus these results reminded us that people usually soak rose in hot water to prepare 'rose tea' as an effective way for health care. Thus, KRD was demonstrated to be a potential drug candidate for combating over-activated Ras-related cancer as an antioxidant.\",\n",

The genetic model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has well-defined mechanisms of stress response, aging, and sexual differentiation. C. elegans has males, but the vast majority of research only uses hermaphrodites. We found that males of the standard N2 laboratory strain were more resistant to hyperosmolarity, heat, and a natural pro-oxidant than hermaphrodites when in mixed-sex groups. Resistance to heat and pro-oxidant were also male-biased in three genetically and geographically diverse C. elegans strains consistent with a species-wide dimorphism that is not specific to domestication. N2 males were also more resistant to heat and pro-oxidant when keep individually indicating that differences in resistance do not require interactions between worms. We found that males induce canonical stress response genes by similar degrees and in similar tissues as hermaphrodites suggesting the importance of other mechanisms. We find that resistance to heat and pro-oxidant are influenced by the sex differentiation transcription factor TRA-1 suggesting that downstream organ differentiation pathways establish differences in stress resistance. Environmental stress influences survival in natural environments, degenerative disease, and aging. Understanding mechanisms of stress response dimorphism can therefore provide insights into sex-specific population dynamics, disease, and longevity.\",\n",

Further studies revealed that ethyl caffeate lowered A&#x3b2; plaques and depressed the expression of A&#x3b2; monomers and oligomers, but did not influence the mRNA levels of A&#x3b2;.

We demonstrate that UA induces upregulation of predominantly antioxidant genes, including the superoxide dismutases (sod-1, sod-5 and sod-3), glutathione S-transferase 7 (gst-7), heat shock protein (hsp-16.2) along with the metal exposure responsive metallothionein (mtl-1 and mtl-2).

We then screened for other gene inactivations that disrupt the induction of these responses by xenobiotic or genetic triggers, identifying 29 gene inactivations required for cytoprotective gene expression. If cytoprotective responses contribute directly to lifespan extension, inactivation of these genes would be expected to compromise the extension of lifespan conferred by decreased insulin/IGF-1 signaling, caloric restriction, or the inhibition of mitochondrial function. We find that inactivation of 25 of 29 cytoprotection-regulatory genes shortens the extension of longevity normally induced by decreased insulin/IGF-1 signaling, disruption of mitochondrial function, or caloric restriction, without disrupting normal longevity nearly as dramatically. These data demonstrate that induction of cytoprotective pathways is central to longevity extension and identify a large set of new genetic components of the pathways that detect cellular damage and couple that detection to downstream cytoprotective effectors.\",\n",

The mechanisms of MeHg-induced neurotoxicity are associated with the disruption of cellular homeostasis, and include oxidative stress, loss of calcium homeostasis, and impaired protein quality control. The stress inducible protein 1 (STI-1) is involved in the regulation of protein quality control by acting as a protein cochaperone to maintain optimal protein unfolding and refolding. Here, we utilized the Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) model of MeHg toxicity to characterize the role of the sti-1 gene in MeHg-induced toxicity. We showed that lifespan and developmental milestone timings were significantly altered in sti-1 knockout (KO) animals with MeHg exposure. However, knocking down sti-1 by RNAi did not result in an analogous effect for lifespan, but did still sensitize to delays in developmental milestone progression by acute MeHg, suggesting that insufficiency of sti-1 does not recapitulate all phenotypes of the null mutation. Furthermore, inhibition of ATP levels by MeHg exposure was modulated by sti-1. Considering that the skn-1/gst-4 pathway is highly involved in metal's toxicity, such pathway was also explored in our model. We showed that sti-1 mutant worms exhibited impaired capacity to upregulate the antioxidant genes skn-1/gst-4, highlighting a central role of sti-1 in modulating antioxidant response. Lastly, we showed that loss-of-function mutation in the rrf-3 gene, which encodes a putative RNA-directed RNA polymerase, has significant effect in altering MeHg-induced toxicity by potentiating the animal's detoxification system. Altogether, our novel data show an indispensable role of protein quality control in the defense against MeHg toxicity.\",\n",

Here, we report that C. elegans brap-2 mutants display increased expression of SKN-1-dependent phase II detoxification enzymes that is dependent on PMK-1 (a p38 MAP kinase C. elegans ortholog). An RNAi screen was conducted using a transcription factor library to identify genes required for increased expression of the SKN-1 target gst-4 in brap-2 mutants. We identified ELT-3, a member of the GATA transcription factor family, as a positive regulator of gst-4p::gfp expression. We found that ELT-3 interacts with SKN-1 to activate gst-4 transcription in vitro and that elt-3 is required for enhanced gst-4 expression in the brap-2(ok1492) mutant in vivo Furthermore, nematodes overexpressing SKN-1 required ELT-3 for lifespan extension. Taken together, these results suggest a model where BRAP-2 acts as negative regulator of SKN-1 through inhibition of p38 MAPK activity and that the GATA transcription factor ELT-3 is required along with SKN-1 for the phase II detoxification response in C. elegans.\",\n",

The aim of this research was to study the antioxidant activity of C. mimosoides extracts in Caenorhabditis elegans, a widely used model organism in this context. METHODS: C. elegans were treated with C. mimosoides extracts in a various concentrations. To investigate the protective effects of the extract against oxidative stress, wild-type N2 were used to determine survival rate under oxidative stress and intracellular ROS. To study underlying mechanisms, the mutant strains with GFP reporter gene including TJ356, CF1553, EU1 and LD4 were used to study DAF-16, SOD-3, SKN-1 and GST-4 gene, respectively. Lifespan and aging pigment of the worms were also investigated. RESULTS: A leaf extract of C. mimosoides improved resistance to oxidative stress and reduced intracellular ROS accumulation in nematodes. The antioxidant effects were mediated through the DAF-16/FOXO pathway and SOD-3 expression, whereas the expression of SKN-1 and GST-4 were not altered. The extract also prolonged lifespan and decreased aging pigments, while the body length and brood size of the worms were not affected by the extract, indicating low toxicity and excluding dietary restriction. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study establish the antioxidant activity of C. mimosoides extract in vivo and suggest its potential as a dietary supplement and alternative medicine to defend against oxidative stress and aging, which should be investigated in intervention studies.\",\n",

However, previous work showed that loss of superoxide dismutase (SOD) only weakly affects lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans. Here, we examined the impact of sod gene deletion and overexpression on the mRNA levels of the remaining sod genes and other detoxification genes. We detected no compensatory upregulation of other sod genes in any of the sod deletion mutants in both wild-type and daf-2(m577) genetic backgrounds when L4 larvae were shifted from 17 to 24 degrees C, and harvested as young adults. Elimination of MnSOD increased transcription of SKN-1 regulated genes and reduced transcription of multiple DAF-16 targets. Loss of the major Cu/ZnSOD isoform SOD-1 caused enhanced expression of subsets of both SKN-1 and DAF-16 targets when the animals were grown continuously at 24 degrees C, and strong overexpression of sod-1 induced a compensatory decrease in all tested SKN-1 regulated gst genes. When combined, these results suggest that low cytosolic SOD may activate SKN-1 signaling, whereas high levels may be repressive. Overall, our results suggest that sod gene manipulation causes complex, combinatorial regulation of expression of individual targets of stress sensitive transcription factors.\",\n",

By establishing a chronic exposure C. elegans model, for the first time, we have shown the propensity of MeHg (5 M, 10 days) to induce bright puncta of dat-1::mCherry aggreagtes in the dendrites of cephalic (2 CEPs) dopaminergic neurons in a dose- and time-dependent manner, while these changes were not found in other dopaminergic neurons: anterior deirids (2 ADEs) and posterior deirids (2 PDEs), cholinergic neurons (2 AIYs) or glutamatergic neurons (2 PVDs). The bright puncta appear as an aggregation of mCherry proteins accumulating in dendrites. Further staining shows that the puncta were not inclusions in lysosome, or amyloid protein aggregates. In addition, features of the puncta including enlarged sphere shape (0.5-2m diameters), bright and accompanying with the shrinkage of the dendrite suggest that the puncta are likely composed of homologous mCherry molecules packaged at the dendritic site for exportation. Moreover, in the glutathione S-transferase 4 (gst-4) transcriptional reporter strain and RT-PCR assay, the expression levels of gst-4 and tubulins (tba-1 and tba-2) genes were not significantly modified under this chronic exposure paradigm, but gst-4 did show significant changes in an one day exposure paradigm. Collectively, these results suggest that CEP dopaminergic neurons are a sensitive target of MeHg, and the current exposure paradigm could be used as a model to investigate mechanism of dopaminergic neurotoxicity.\",\n",

Whereas acute stressors, such as predation, induce a rapid and energy-demanding fight-or-flight response, long-term environmental stressors induce the gradual and long-lasting activation of highly conserved cytoprotective processes<sup>1-3</sup>. In animals across the evolutionary spectrum, continued activation of the fight-or-flight response weakens the animal's resistance to environmental challenges<sup>4,5</sup>. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate the trade-off between the flight response and long-term stressors are poorly understood. Here we show that repeated induction of the flight response in Caenorhabditis elegans shortens lifespan and inhibits conserved cytoprotective mechanisms. The flight response activates neurons that release tyramine, an invertebrate analogue of adrenaline and noradrenaline. Tyramine stimulates the insulin-IGF-1 signalling (IIS) pathway and precludes the induction of stress response genes by activating an adrenergic-like receptor in the intestine. By contrast, long-term environmental stressors, such as heat or oxidative stress, reduce tyramine release and thereby allow the induction of cytoprotective genes. These findings demonstrate that a neural stress hormone supplies a state-dependent neural switch between acute flight and long-term environmental stress responses and provides mechanistic insights into how the flight response impairs cellular defence systems and accelerates ageing.\",\n",

Survival after oxidative stress or ultraviolet irradiation was significantly increased by pre-treatment of phlorizin. Dietary supplementation with phlorizin also significantly extended lifespans without reducing fertility. Age-related decline of muscle function was delayed by supplementation with phlorizin. Phlorizin induced the expression of stress-responsive genes hsp-16.2 and sod-3 and nuclear localization of DAF-16, a FOXO transcription factor modulating stress response and lifespan in C. elegans. Amyloid-beta-induced toxicity was significantly reduced by phlorizin. This effect was dependent on DAF-16 and SKN-1. Increased mortality induced with a high-glucose diet was partially prevented by phlorizin via SKN-1. Inactivation of dopaminergic neurons observed in a Parkinson's disease model was completely recovered by supplementation with phlorizin. Genetic analysis suggests that lifespan extension by phlorizin is mediated through oxidative stress response and autophagy.

Reserpine was toxic to worms (decreased the survival, food intake, development and changed egg laying and defecation cycles). In addition, reserpine increased the worms' locomotor rate on food and decreased dopamine levels. Morphological evaluations of dopaminergic CEP neurons confirmed neurodegeneration characterized by decreased fluorescence intensity and the number of worms with intact CEP neurons, and increased number of shrunken somas per worm. These effects were unrelated to reserpine's effect on decreased expression of the dopamine transporter, dat-1. Interestingly, the locomotor rate on food and the neurodegenerative parameters fully recovered to basal conditions upon reserpine withdrawal. Furthermore, reserpine decreased survival in vesicular monoamine transporter and dat-1 loss-of-function mutant worms. In addition, worms pre-exposed to dopamine followed by exposure to reserpine had decreased survival. Reserpine activated gst-4, which controls a phase II detoxification enzymes downstream of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived-2)-like 2.

Moreover, variations of lipid accumulation observed in treated worms correlated with transcriptional levels of fatty acid synthesis genes and with the involvement of peptide transporter PEP-2.

Although current anthelmintics are effective against many nematode infections, there is growing concern that resistance could threaten this mode of treatment. Pharmacological compounds that target xenobiotic detoxification pathways, which lead to multidrug resistance can greatly increase the useful life of current and future anthelmintics. The transcription factor SKN-1 is essential for the development of nematode embryos and activates the expression of 65 genes predicted to promote modification, conjugation, or export of drugs [1]. We have identified a major pathway regulating SKN-1 that is distinct from the major pathway regulating xenobiotic detoxification in mammals. SKN-1 also binds to target DNA by a unique monomeric mechanism relative to all other known basic leucine zipper factors [2,3]. Hence, SKN-1 is a promising target for the development of inhibitors that disrupt embryonic development, decrease stress resistance, and inhibit xenobiotic detoxification in nematodes without affecting homologous pathways in humans. We have successfully carried out a HTS screening of the MLSMR library to identify inhibitors of the transcriptional activation of the SKN-1 pathway in C. elegans through use of promoters of the SKN-1 target gene gst-4 (Pgst-4::GFP), which can be detected through simple fluorescence measurements. We report for the first time a small molecule inhibitor of the SKN-1 pathway, ML358, which resulted from a vanillamine derived scaffold identified from the HTS program and advanced through analog synthesis and structure-activity studies.

ML358 is non-toxic to both C. elegans (LC50 &gt; 64 M) and Fa2N-4 immortalized human hepatocytes (LC50 &gt; 50M). In addition, ML358, has good solubility, permeability, chemical and metabolic stability in human and mouse liver microsomes. ML358 is a valuable probe to study the function and relevance of the transcription factor SKN-1 in drug detoxification and resistance in parasitic nematodes. Currently available drugs target only a specific enzyme or enzyme class and/or affect homologous human targets. By selective targeting of the SKN-1 pathway present in diverse nematode clades, ML358 can potentially lead to drug candidates that could be used as adjuvants to increase the efficacy of current anthelmintics.\",\n",

In both organisms, activation of hsp genes in response to mitochondrial impairment is distinct from their responses to heat shock and is not associated with oxidative stress. Thus, mitochondria-to-nucleus signaling to express a hsp gene network is apparently a widespread retrograde mechanism to facilitate cell defense\",\n",

However, little is known about their effects on aging. This work aimed to investigate the effects of extracts of AOF on longevity and stress resistance in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) and the mechanisms that underlie its effects. Methods: Wild-type (WT) strand of C.elegans (N2)worms were cultured in growth medium with or without AOF. First, we examined the effects of AOF on lifespan, reproduction and healthspan assay, stress resistance and oxidative analysis, lipofuscin levels. Second, The levels of ROS and MDA, the antioxidant enzyme activities were examined to explore the underlying mechanism of AOF. Finally, the expression of the longevity-related genes were investigated to further understand the AOF's underlying mechanism. Results: The lifespan of C. elegans was prolonged by 23.44% after treatment with high-dose AOF (100 ug/ml). AOF alleviated aging-related declines in C. elegans health and enhanced resistance to heat shock. Furthermore, AOF decreased reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde, increased the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase, and reduced accumulation of fat. AOF upregulated the expression of sod-3, gst-4, daf-16, and skn-1 but downregulated the expression of daf-2 and age-1 and accelerated the translocation of DAF-16 into the nucleus. The extended lifespan induced by AOF was reversed in daf-16(mu86) and skn-1(zu135) mutants, indicating that this gene is involved in AOF-regulated longevity. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated that AOF extends lifespan and healthspan and enhances stress via boosting the activity of the antioxidant enzyme and controlling the expression of genes associated with insulin/IGF signaling and SKN-1 pathways. As a result, this work suggested AOF as a possible candidate to reduce the signs of aging by activating and inhibiting target genes.\",\n",

Here, we provide a strategy by use of alternative in vitro (cell cultures) and in vivo (Caenorhabditis elegans, hen's egg test) approaches for detailed investigation of the impact of commonly used rosemary, citrus and eucalyptus essential oil on acute, developmental and reproductive toxicity as well as on mucous membrane irritation. In general, all EOs under study exhibited a comparable impact on measured parameters, with a slightly increased toxic potential of rosemary oil. In vitro cell culture results indicated a concentration-dependent decrease of cell viability for all EOs, with mean IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 0.08 to 0.17% [v/v]. Similar results were obtained for the C. elegans model when using a sensitized bus-5 mutant strain, with a mean LC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.42% [v/v]. In wild-type nematodes, approximately tenfold higher LC<sub>50</sub> values were detected. C. elegans development and reproduction was already significantly inhibited at concentrations of 0.5% (wild-type) and 0.1% (bus-5) [v/v] of EO, respectively. Gene expression analysis revealed a significant upregulation of xenobiotic and oxidative stress genes such as cyp-14a3, gst-4, gpx-6 and sod-3. Furthermore, all three EOs under study showed an increased short-time mucous membrane irritation potential, already at 0.5% [v/v] of EO. Finally, GC-MS analysis was performed to quantitate the relative concentration of the most prominent EO compounds. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that EOs can exhibit severe toxic properties, already at low concentrations. Therefore, a detailed toxicological assessment is highly recommended for each EO and single intended application.\",\n",

In the model nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, dietary exposure to dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA), an omega-6 fatty acid, causes the destruction of germ cells and leads to sterility. In this study we used genetic and microscopic approaches to further characterize this phenomenon. We found that strains carrying mutations in genes involved in lipid homeostasis enhanced sterility phenotypes, while mutations reducing the activity of the conserved insulin/IGF signaling pathway suppressed sterility phenotypes. Exposure to a mild heat stress prior to omega-6 fatty acid treatment led to an adaptive or hormetic response, resulting in less sterility. Mutations in skn-1 and knockdown of genes encoding phase II detoxification enzymes led to increased sterility in the presence of dietary DGLA. Thus, detoxification systems and genetic changes that increase overall stress responses protect the germ cells from destruction. Microscopic analyses revealed that dietary DGLA leads to deterioration of germ cell membranes in the proliferative and transition zones of the developing germ line.

Curcumin also showed AhR-independent anti-aging activities, such as protection against aggregation-prone proteins and oxidative stress in <i>C. elegans</i> and promotion of the migratory capacity of human primary endothelial cells. These AhR-independent effects are largely mediated by the Nrf2/SKN-1 pathway.\",\n",

However, many compounds identified in screens using cell culture models are often found to be toxic or pharmacologically inactive in vivo(1-2). Screening in whole animal models can help avoid these pitfalls and streamline the path to drug development. C. elegans is a multicellular model organism well suited for HTS. It is small (&lt;1 mm) and can be economically cultured and dispensed in liquids. C. elegans is also one of the most experimentally tractable animal models permitting rapid and detailed identification of drug mode-of-action(3). We describe a protocol for culturing and dispensing fluorescent strains of C. elegans for high-throughput screening of chemical libraries or detection of environmental contaminants that alter the expression of a specific gene. Large numbers of developmentally synchronized worms are grown in liquid culture, harvested, washed, and suspended at a defined density. Worms are then added to black, flat-bottomed 384-well plates using a peristaltic liquid dispenser. Small molecules from a chemical library or test samples (e.g., water, food, or soil) can be added to wells with worms. In vivo, real-time fluorescence intensity is measured with a fluorescence microplate reader. This method can be adapted to any inducible gene in C. elegans for which a suitable reporter is available. Many inducible stress and developmental transcriptional pathways are well defined in C. elegans and GFP transgenic reporter strains already exist for many of them(4). When combined with the appropriate transgenic reporters, our method can be used to screen for pathway modulators or to develop robust biosensor assays for environmental contaminants. We demonstrate our C. elegans culture and dispensing protocol with an HTS assay we developed to monitor the C. elegans cap 'n' collar transcription factor SKN-1. SKN-1 and its mammalian homologue Nrf2 activate cytoprotective genes during oxidative and xenobiotic stress(5-10). Nrf2 protects mammals from numerous age-related disorders such as cancer, neurodegeneration, and chronic inflammation and has become a major chemotherapeutic target(11-13).Our assay is based on a GFP transgenic reporter for the SKN-1 target gene gst-4(14), which encodes a glutathione-s transferase(6). The gst-4 reporter is also a biosensor for xenobiotic and oxidative chemicals that activate SKN-1 and can be used to detect low levels of contaminants such as acrylamide and methyl-mercury(15-16).\",\n",

Previously, we showed that dietary dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA; 20: 3(n-6)) triggers ferroptosis in the germ cells of the model organism, Caenorhabditis elegans. We also demonstrated that ether lipid-deficient mutant strains are sensitive to DGLA-induced ferroptosis, suggesting a protective role for ether lipids. The vinyl ether bond unique to plasmalogen lipids has been hypothesized to function as an antioxidant, but this has not been tested in animal models. In this study, we used C. elegans mutants to test the hypothesis that the vinyl ether bond in plasmalogens acts as an antioxidant to protect against germ cell ferroptosis as well as to protect from whole-body tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP)-induced oxidative stress. We found no role for plasmalogens in either process. Instead, we demonstrate that ether lipid-deficiency disrupts lipid homeostasis in C. elegans, leading to altered ratios of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) content in cellular membranes. We demonstrate that ferroptosis sensitivity in both wild type and ether-lipid deficient mutants can be rescued in several ways that change the relative abundance of saturated fats, MUFAs and specific polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Specifically, we reduced ferroptosis sensitivity by (1) using mutant strains unable to synthesize DGLA, (2) using a strain carrying a gain-of-function mutation in the transcriptional mediator MDT-15, or (3) by dietary supplementation of MUFAs. Furthermore, our studies reveal important differences in how dietary lipids influence germ cell ferroptosis versus whole-body peroxide-induced oxidative stress.

      "        \"abstract\": \"BACKGROUND: Recognition of stress and mobilization of adequate &quot;fight-or-flight&quot; responses is key for survival and health. Previous studies have shown that exposure of Caenorhabditis elegans to pathogens or toxins simultaneously stimulates cellular stress and detoxification responses and aversive behavior. However, whether a coordinated regulation exists between cytoprotective stress responses and behavioral defenses remains unclear. RESULTS: Here, we show that exposure of C. elegans to high concentrations of naturally attractive food-derived odors, benzaldehyde and diacetyl, induces toxicity and food avoidance behavior. Benzaldehyde preconditioning activates systemic cytoprotective stress responses involving DAF-16/FOXO, SKN-1/Nrf2, and Hsp90 in non-neuronal cells, which confer both physiological (increased survival) and behavioral tolerance (reduced food avoidance) to benzaldehyde exposure. Benzaldehyde preconditioning also elicits behavioral cross-tolerance to the structurally similar methyl-salicylate, but not to the structurally unrelated diacetyl. In contrast, diacetyl preconditioning augments diacetyl avoidance, weakens physiological diacetyl tolerance, and does not induce apparent molecular defenses. The inter-tissue connection between cellular and behavioral defenses is mediated by JNK-like stress-activated protein kinases and the neuropeptide Y receptor NPR-1. Reinforcement of the stressful experiences using spaced training forms stable stress-specific memories. Memory retrieval by the olfactory cues leads to avoidance of food contaminated by diacetyl and context-dependent behavioral decision to avoid benzaldehyde only if there is an alternative, food-indicative odor. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals a regulatory link between conserved cytoprotective stress responses and behavioral avoidance, which underlies &quot;fight-or-flight&quot; responses and facilitates self-protection in real and anticipated stresses. These findings imply that variations in the efficiency of physiological protection during past episodes of stress might shape current behavioral decisions.\",\n",

We used a SKN-1Colon, two colonsGFP translational fusion to record changes in both skn-1 expression and SKN-1 nuclear localization, and a gst-4Colon, two colonsGFP transcriptional fusion to measure SKN-1 transcriptional activity. GST-4 is involved in the Phase II oxidative stress response and its expression is lost in a skn-1(zu67) mutant. In this study, we show that the regulation of skn-1 is tied to the protein-degradation machinery of the cell. RNAi-targeted removal of most proteasome subunits in C. elegans caused nuclear localization of SKN-1 and in some cases induced transcription of gst-4. Most intriguingly, RNAi knockdown of proteasome core subunits caused nuclear localization of SKN-1 and induced gst-4, while RNAi knockdown of proteasome regulatory subunits resulted in nuclear localization of SKN-1 but did not induce gst-4. RNAi knockdown of ubiquitin-specific hydrolases and chaperonin components also caused nuclear localization of SKN-1 and in some cases also induced gst-4 transcription. skn-1 activation by proteasome dysfunction could be occurring by one or several mechanisms: 1) the reduced processivity of dysfunctional proteasomes may allow oxidatively damaged by-products to build-up which, in turn, activate the skn-1 stress response; 2) dysfunctional proteasomes may activate the skn-1 stress-response by blocking the constitutive turnover of SKN-1; 3) dysfunctional proteasomes may activate an unidentified signaling pathway that feeds back to control the skn-1 stress-response.\",\n",

The findings could provide the pharmacological basis for a treatment in traditional medicine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Lifespan extension by BSPO was evaluated under normal culture conditions and in a stress test. A possible mechanism of the anti-aging effect of BSPO, a change in the stress-resistance of related proteins, was also investigated in C. elegans. RESULTS: It has been shown that BSPO could significantly extend lifespan of C. elegans in a concentration dependent manner under normal culture conditions and stress. Further studies demonstrated that BSPO treatment significantly decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, up-regulated resistance to stress of related proteins, including glutathione S-transferase-4 (GST-4) and heat shock protein-16.2 (HSP-16.2), and reduced the amount of lipofuscin in transgenic C. elegans. CONCLUSION: These results indicated that BSPO extended the lifespan, which could be attributed to its direct ROS scavenging activity, reducing the amount of lipofuscin and increasing the expression of gens associated with resistance to stress.

In C. elegans, hcf-1 inactivation caused a daf-16-dependent lifespan extension of up to 40% and heightened resistance to specific stress stimuli.

Gene expression and functional RNAi-based analyses identified the tissue-specific GATA transcription factor ELT-2 as a major regulator of an early intestinal protective response to infection with the human bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In the adult worm, ELT-2 is required specifically for infection responses and survival on pathogen but makes no significant contribution to gene expression associated with intestinal maintenance or to resistance to cadmium, heat, and oxidative stress.

DEPS-1 is required for the proper localization of PGL-1 to P granules, the accumulation of glh-1 mRNA and protein, and germ cell proliferation and fertility at elevated temperatures. In addition, DEPS-1 is required for RNA interference (RNAi) of germline-expressed genes, possibly because DEPS-1 promotes the accumulation of RDE-4, a dsRNA-binding protein required for RNAi. A genome wide analysis of gene expression in deps-1 mutant germ lines identified additional targets of DEPS-1 regulation, many of which are also regulated by the RNAi factor RDE-3. Our studies suggest that DEPS-1 is a key component of the P-granule assembly pathway and that its roles include promoting accumulation of some mRNAs, such as glh-1 and rde-4, and reducing accumulation of other mRNAs, perhaps by collaborating with RDE-3 to generate endogenous short interfering RNAs (endo-siRNAs).\",\n",

The influence of lipids on the immune response is both complex and diverse, with multiple studies pointing to the beneficial effects of long-chain fatty acids in immunity. However, the mechanisms through which PUFAs modulate innate immunity and the effects of PUFA deficiencies on innate immune functions remain to be clarified. Using the Caenorhabditis elegans-Pseudomonas aeruginosa host-pathogen system, we present genetic evidence that a Delta6-desaturase FAT-3, through its two 18-carbon products-gamma-linolenic acid (GLA, 18:3n6) and stearidonic acid (SDA, 18:4n3), but not the 20-carbon PUFAs arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4n6) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n3)-is required for basal innate immunity in vivo. Deficiencies in GLA and SDA result in increased susceptibility to bacterial infection, which is associated with reduced basal expression of a number of immune-specific genes-including spp-1, lys-7, and lys-2-that encode antimicrobial peptides. GLA and SDA are required to maintain basal activity of the p38 MAP kinase pathway, which plays important roles in protecting metazoan animals from infections and oxidative stress. Transcriptional and functional analyses of fat-3-regulated genes revealed that fat-3 is required in the intestine to regulate the expression of infection- and stress-response genes, and that distinct sets of genes are specifically required for immune function and oxidative stress response. Our study thus uncovers a mechanism by which these 18-carbon PUFAs affect basal innate immune function and, consequently, the ability of an organism to defend itself against bacterial infections. The conservation of p38 MAP kinase signaling in both stress and immune responses further encourages exploring the function of GLA and SDA in humans.\",\n",

The nuclear hormone receptor NHR-45 and the transcriptional Mediator component MDT-15/MED15 are required for the transcriptional activation of cyp-14A4 by mitochondrial mutations, gene inactivations, or toxins. A genetic screen for mutations that fail to activate this cytochrome p450 gene upon drug or mutation-induced mitochondrial dysfunction identified a DNA helicase ARIP-4 that functions in concert with the NHR-45 transcriptional regulatory cascade. In response to mitochondrial dysfunction, ARIP-4 and NHR-45 protein interaction is enhanced, and they relocalize from the nuclear periphery to the interior of intestinal nuclei. NHR-45/ARIP-4 also regulates the transcriptional activation of the eol-1 gene that encodes a decapping enzyme required for enhanced RNAi and transgene silencing of mitochondrial mutants. In the absence of arip-4, animals were more susceptible to the mitochondrial inhibitor antimycin. Thus, ARIP-4 serves as a transcriptional coactivator of NHR-45 to promote this defense response. A null mutation in arip-4 extends the life span and health span of both wild type and a mitochondrial mutant, suggesting that the activation of detoxification pathways is deleterious to health when the mitochondrial dysfunction is caused by mutation that cannot be cytochrome p450-detoxified. Thus, arip-4 acts in a pathway that couples mitochondrial surveillance to the activation of downstream immunity, detoxification, and RNAi responses.\",\n",

In this study, we used Caenorhabditis elegans to investigate such mechanisms. Since very little is known about the microbes interacting with C. elegans in its natural environment, we began by taking the first steps to characterize the C. elegans microbiota. We established a natural-like environment in which initially germfree, wild-type larvae were grown on enriched soil. Bacterial members of the adult C. elegans microbiota were isolated by culture and identified using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Using pure cultures of bacterial isolates as food, we identified two, Bacillus megaterium and Pseudomonas mendocina, that enhanced resistance to a subsequent infection with the Gram-negative pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Whereas protection by B. megaterium was linked to impaired egg laying, corresponding to a known trade-off between fecundity and resistance, the mechanism underlying protection conferred by P. mendocina depended on weak induction of immune genes regulated by the p38 MAPK pathway. Disruption of the p38 ortholog, pmk-1, abolished protection. P. mendocina enhanced resistance to P. aeruginosa but not to the Gram-positive pathogen Enterococcus faecalis. Furthermore, protection from P. aeruginosa was similarly induced by a P. aeruginosa gacA mutant with attenuated virulence but not by a different C. elegans-associated Pseudomonas sp. isolate. Our results support a pivotal role for the conserved p38 pathway in microbiota-initiated immune protection and suggest that similarity between microbiota members and pathogens may play a role in such protection.\",\n",

Persistent effects of exposure and the mechanism of neuronal degeneration are continuing issues in OP toxicology. To elucidate early steps in the mechanisms of OP toxicity, we studied alterations in global gene and protein expression in Caenorhabditis elegans exposed to OPs using microarrays and mass spectrometry. We tested two structurally distinct OPs (dichlorvos and fenamiphos) and employed a mechanistically different third neurotoxicant, mefloquine, as an out-group for analysis. Treatment levels used concentrations of chemical sufficient to prevent the development of 10%, 50% or 90% of mid-vulval L4 larvae into early gravid adults (EGA) at 24 h after exposure in a defined, bacteria-free medium. RESULTS: After 8 h of exposure, the expression of 87 genes responded specifically to OP treatment. The abundance of 34 proteins also changed in OP-exposed worms. Many of the genes and proteins affected by the OPs are expressed in neuronal and muscle tissues and are involved in lipid metabolism, cell adhesion, apoptosis/cell death, and detoxification. Twenty-two genes were differentially affected by the two OPs; a large proportion of these genes encode cytochrome P450s, UDP-glucuronosyl/UDP-glucosyltransferases, or P-glycoproteins. The abundance of transcripts and the proteins they encode were well correlated. CONCLUSION: Exposure to OPs elicits a pattern of changes in gene expression in exposed worms distinct from that of the unrelated neurotoxicant, mefloquine. The functional roles and the tissue location of the genes and proteins whose expression is modulated in response to exposure is consistent with the known effects of OPs, including damage to muscle due to persistent hypercontraction, neuronal cell death, and phase I and phase II detoxification. Further, the two different OPs evoked distinguishable changes in gene expression; about half the differences are in genes involved in detoxification, likely reflecting differences in the chemical structure of the two OPs. Changes in the expression of a number of sequences of unknown function were also discovered, and these molecules could provide insight into novel mechanisms of OP toxicity or adaptation in future studies.\",\n",

While defense in epithelial cells can be triggered by pattern recognition receptor-mediated detection of microbe-associated molecular patterns, there is much to be learned about how they sense infection via perturbations of host physiology, which often occur during infection. A recently described host defense response in the nematode C. elegans called the Intracellular Pathogen Response (IPR) can be triggered by infection with diverse natural intracellular pathogens, as well as by perturbations to protein homeostasis. From a forward genetic screen, we identified the C. elegans ortholog of purine nucleoside phosphorylase pnp-1 as a negative regulator of IPR gene expression, as well as a negative regulator of genes induced by extracellular pathogens. Accordingly, pnp-1 mutants have resistance to both intracellular and extracellular pathogens. Metabolomics analysis indicates that C. elegans pnp-1 likely has enzymatic activity similar to its human ortholog, serving to convert purine nucleosides into free bases. Classic genetic studies have shown how mutations in human purine nucleoside phosphorylase cause immunodeficiency due to T-cell dysfunction. Here we show that C. elegans pnp-1 acts in intestinal epithelial cells to regulate defense. Altogether, these results indicate that perturbations in purine metabolism are likely monitored as a cue to promote defense against epithelial infection in the nematode C. elegans.\",\n",

Expression of F35E12.5 is predominantly regulated through the p38 MAPK pathway; however, intriguingly the lifespan extension resulting from Harmane was higher in p38 MAPK-deficient nematodes. This indicates that Harmane has a complex effect on the innate immune system of C. elegans. Harmane could therefore be a useful tool in the further research into C. elegans immunity. Since the innate immunity of C. elegans has a high degree of evolutionary conservation, drugs such as Harmane could also be possible alternatives to classic antibiotics. The C. elegans model could prove to be useful for selection and development of such drugs.\",\n",

To explore the genomic responses that the worm activates after pathogenic attack we used microarray analysis of transcriptional changes induced after 6-h infection, comparing virulent with avirulent infection. We defined 89 genes with statistically significant expression changes of at least twofold, of which 68 were up-regulated and 21 were down-regulated. Among the former, those encoding C-type lectin domains were the most abundant class. Many of the 89 genes exhibit genomic clustering, and we identified one large cluster of 62 genes, of which most were induced in response to infection. We tested 41 of the induced genes for involvement in immunity using mutants or RNAi, finding that six of these are required for the swelling response and five are required more generally for defense. Our results indicate that C-type lectins and other putative pathogen-recognition molecules are important for innate immune defense in C. elegans. We also found significant induction of genes encoding lysozymes, proteases, and defense-related proteins, as well as various domains of unknown function.

However, the significance of these enzymes and the relevant functions of d-amino acids remain unclear. Here, we show that in the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, the serine racemase homolog SERR-1 and d-amino acid oxidase DAAO-1 control an adaptive foraging behavior. Similar to many organisms, <i>C. elegans</i> immediately initiates local search for food when transferred to a new environment. With prolonged food deprivation, the worms exhibit a long-range dispersal behavior as the adaptive foraging strategy. We found that <i>serr-1</i> deletion mutants did not display this behavior, whereas <i>daao-1</i> deletion mutants immediately engaged in long-range dispersal after food removal. A quantitative analysis of d-amino acids indicated that d-serine and d-alanine are both synthesized and suppressed during food deprivation. A behavioral pharmacological analysis showed that the long-range dispersal behavior requires NMDA receptor desensitization. Long-term pretreatment with d-alanine, as well as with an NMDA receptor agonist, expanded the area searched by wild-type worms immediately after food removal, whereas pretreatment with d-serine did not. We propose that d-serine and d-alanine are endogenous regulators that cooperatively induce the long-range dispersal behavior in <i>C. elegans</i> through actions on the NMDA receptor.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b>In mammals, d-serine functions as an important neuromodulator of the NMDA-type glutamate receptor, which regulates higher brain functions.

Hence, it is sometimes challenging to relate the properties of receptors reconstituted in heterologous expression systems to those of their native counterparts. Here we show that the properties of Caenorhabditis elegans levamisole-sensitive acetylcholine receptors (L-AChRs), the ionotropic acetylcholine receptors targeted by the cholinergic anthelmintic levamisole at neuromuscular junctions, can be profoundly modified by their clustering machinery. We uncovered that L-AChRs exhibit a strong outward rectification invivo, which was not previously described in heterologous systems. This unusual feature for an ionotropic AChR is abolished by disrupting the interaction of the receptors with the extracellular complex required for their synaptic clustering. When recorded at -60 mV, levamisole-induced currents are similar in the wild type and in L-AChR-clustering-defective mutants, while they are halved in these mutants at more depolarized physiological membrane potentials. Consequently, levamisole causes a strong muscle depolarization in the wild type, which leads to complete inactivation of the voltage-gated calcium channels and to an irreversible flaccid paralysis. In mutants defective for L-AChR clustering, the levamisole-induced depolarization is weaker, allowing voltage-gated calcium channels to remain partially active, which eventually leads to adaptation and survival of the worms. This explains why historical screens for C. elegans mutants resistant to levamisole identified the components of the L-AChR clustering machinery, in addition to proteins required for receptor biosynthesis or efficacy. This work further emphasizes the importance of pursuing ligand-gated channel characterization in their native environment.\",\n",

Site of action studies reveal that before invasion, localized UNC-6 secretion directs its receptor, UNC-40, to the plasma membrane of the AC, in contact with the basement membrane. There, UNC-40 polarizes a specialized invasive membrane domain through the enrichment of actin regulators, F-actin and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P(2)). Cell ablation experiments indicate that UNC-6 promotes the formation of invasive protrusions from the AC that break down the basement membrane in response to a subsequent vulval cue.

Hidden Markov models of cadherin domains were matched to the protein sequences obtained from the translation of the predicted gene sequences. Matches were made to 21 C. elegans and 18 D. melanogaster sequences. Experimental and theoretical work on C. elegans sequences, and data from ESTs, show that three pairs of genes, and two triplets, should be merged to form five single genes. It also produced sequence changes at one or both of the 5' and 3' termini of half the sequences. In D. melanogaster it is probable that two of the cadherin genes should also be merged together and that three cadherin genes should be merged with other neighbouring genes.Of the 15 cadherin proteins found in C. elegans, 13 have the features of cell surface proteins, signal sequences and transmembrane helices; the other two have only signal sequences. Of the 17 in D. melanogaster, 11 at present have both features and another five have transmembrane helices. The evidence currently available suggests about one-third of the cadherins in the two organisms can be grouped into subfamilies in which all, or parts of, the molecules are conserved. Each organism also has a approximately 980 residue protein (CDH-11 and CG11059) with two cadherin domains and whose sequences match well over their entire length two proteins from human brain. Two proteins in C. elegans, HMR-1A and HMR-1B, and three in D. melanogaster, CadN, Shg and CG7527, have cytoplasmic domains homologous to those of the classical cadherin genes of chordates but their extracellular regions have different domain structures. Other common subclasses include the seven-helix membrane cadherins, Fat-like protocadherins and the Ret-like cadherins. At present, the remaining cadherins have no obvious similarities in their extracellular domain architecture or homologies to their cytoplasmic domains and may, therefore, represent species-specific or phylum-specific molecules.\",\n",

Regulation by DAF-2 is most likely DAF-16 independent for dao-3 and hsp-90. RNA levels of dao-5 and dao-6 showed elevated expression in daf-2 adults, as well as being strongly expressed in dauer larvae. In contrast, hsp-90 transcript levels are low in daf-2 mutant adults though they are enriched in dauer larvae, indicating overlapping but not identical mechanisms of efficient life maintenance in stress-resistant dauer larvae and long-lived daf-2 mutant adults. dao-1, dao-8 and dao-9 are homologs of the FK506 binding proteins that interact with the mammalian insulin pathway. dao-3 encodes a putative methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase.

The molecules and reactions that drive these dynamics in vivo are not well understood. In this study, we present evidence that a group of intrinsically disordered, serine-rich proteins regulate the dynamics of P granules in C. elegans embryos. The MEG (maternal-effect germline defective) proteins are germ plasm components that are required redundantly for fertility. We demonstrate that MEG-1 and MEG-3 are substrates of the kinase MBK-2/DYRK and the phosphatase PP2A(PPTR-1/2). Phosphorylation of the MEGs promotes granule disassembly and dephosphorylation promotes granule assembly. Using lattice light sheet microscopy on live embryos, we show that GFP-tagged MEG-3 localizes to a dynamic domain that surrounds and penetrates each granule. We conclude that, despite their liquid-like behavior, P granules are non-homogeneous structures whose assembly in embryos is regulated by phosphorylation.\",\n",

Localization of MEG-1 to P granules depends upon the membrane-bound protein MES-1. meg-1 mutants exhibit multiple germline defects: P-granule mis-segregation in embryos, underproliferation and aberrant P-granule morphology in larval germ cells, and ultimately, sterility as adults. The penetrance of meg-1 phenotypes increases when meg-2 is also absent. Loss of the P-granule component pgl-1 in meg-1 mutants increases germ-cell proliferation, while loss of glh-1 decreases proliferation.

To investigate meg-1 function, we conducted a targeted RNAi screen for enhancers and suppressors of meg-1 sterility. Here, we show that meg-1 interacts with multiple pathways that promote germ cell proliferation and survival. Surprisingly, we found that two nanos family members had opposing effects on the meg-1 phenotype. Loss of nos-3 suppressed the meg-1 phenotype, restoring fertility, while loss of nos-2 enhanced the meg-1 phenotype, abolishing proliferation and causing early and pronounced germ cell degeneration. Together, our analyses suggest that, under circumstances that favor proliferation, MEG function is not essential for germ cells to proliferate, although it is important for optimal proliferation.

Here we investigate the phenotypic consequences of multicellular life at the lower bounds of rDNA copy number. We use the model Caenorhabditis elegans, which has previously been found to complete embryogenesis using only maternally-provided ribosomes. We find that individuals with rDNA copy number reduced to &#x223c;5% of wild type are capable of further development with variable penetrance. Such individuals are sterile and exhibit severe morphological defects, particularly in post-embryonically dividing tissues such as germline and vulva. Developmental completion and fertility are supported by an rDNA copy number &#x223c;10% of wild type, with substantially delayed development. Worms with rDNA copy number reduced to &#x223c;33% of wild type display a subtle developmental timing defect that was absent in worms with higher copy numbers. Our results support the hypothesis that rDNA requirements vary across tissues and indicate that the minimum rDNA copy number for fertile adulthood is substantially less than the lowest naturally-observed total copy number.

Their structures have been mostly explored with low-resolution genetic techniques (e.g. fluorescence in situ hybridization or PCR), before genomic mapping and molecular characterization through sequencing became feasible. As a result, the precise nature of most chromosomal rearrangements remains unknown, whereas, more recently, balancers have been engineered using the CRISPR-Cas9 technique for which the structure of the chromosomal rearrangement has been predesigned. Using short-read whole-genome sequencing (srWGS) and tailored bioinformatic analyses, we previously interpreted the structure of four chromosomal balancers randomly created by mutagenesis processes. Here, we have extended our analyses to 5 CRISPR-Cas9 balancers and 17 additional traditional balancing rearrangements. We detected and experimentally validated their breakpoints and have interpreted the balancer structures. Many of the balancers were found to be more intricate than previously described, being composed of complex genomic rearrangements (CGRs) such as chromoanagenesis-like events. Furthermore, srWGS revealed additional structural variants and CGRs not known to be part of the balancer genomes. Altogether, our study provides a comprehensive resource of complex genomic variations in C. elegans and highlights the power of srWGS to study the complexity of genomes by applying tailored analyses.\",\n",

We show functions for the 19S RP in regulation of proliferation and maintenance of integrity of mitotic zone nuclei, in polymerization of the synaptonemal complex (SC) onto meiotic chromosomes and in the timing of SC subunit redistribution to the short arm of the bivalent, and in turnover of XND-1 proteins at late pachytene. Furthermore, we report that certain 19S RP subunits are required for proper germ line localization of WEE-1.3, a major meiotic kinase. Additionally, endogenous fluorescent labeling revealed that the two isoforms of the essential 19S RP proteasome subunit RPN-6.1 are expressed in a tissue-specific manner in the hermaphrodite. Also, we demonstrate that the 19S RP subunits RPN-6.1 and RPN-7 are crucial for the nuclear localization of the lid subunits RPN-8 and RPN-9 in oocytes, further supporting the ability to utilize the C. elegans germ line as a model to study proteasome assembly real-time. Collectively, our data support the premise that certain 19S RP proteasome subunits are playing tissue-specific roles, especially in the germ line.

Here we show that axon regeneration in aging C. elegans motor neurons is inhibited by the conserved insulin/IGF1 receptor DAF-2. DAF-2s function in regeneration is mediated by intrinsic neuronal activity of the forkhead transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO. DAF-16 regulates regeneration independently of lifespan, indicating that neuronal aging is an intrinsic, neuron specific, and genetically regulated process. In addition, we found that daf-18/PTEN inhibits regeneration independently of age and FOXO signaling, via the TOR pathway. Finally, DLK-1, a conserved regulator of regeneration, is downregulated by insulin/IGF1 signaling, bound by DAF-16 in neurons, and is required for both DAF-16- and DAF-18-mediated regeneration. Together, our data establish that insulin signaling specifically inhibits regeneration in aging adult neurons, and that this mechanism is independent of PTEN and TOR. \\nContent:' metadata={'source': '/Users/dan/Code/Python/pub_worm/notebooks/output/PMC3924874.txt', 'title': 'Insulin/IGF1 signaling inhibits age-dependent axon regeneration.', 'url': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3924874/'}\n",

In the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, lack of the RFX transcription factor DAF-19 leads to the absence of cilia normally found on 60 sensory neurons. We now describe and functionally characterize three different isoforms of DAF-19. The short isoform DAF-19C is specifically expressed in ciliated sensory neurons and sufficient to rescue all cilia-related phenotypes of daf-19 mutants. In contrast, the long isoforms DAF-19A/B function in basically all nonciliated neurons. We discovered behavioral and cellular phenotypes in daf-19 mutants that depend on the isoforms daf-19a/b. These novel synaptic maintenance phenotypes are reminiscent of synaptic decline seen in many human neurodegenerative disorders. The C. elegans daf-19 mutant worms can thus serve as a molecular model for the mechanisms of functional neuronal decline. \\nContent:' metadata={'source': '/Users/dan/Code/Python/pub_worm/notebooks/output/PMC2592639.txt', 'title': 'Distinct isoforms of the RFX transcription factor DAF-19 regulate ciliogenesis and maintenance of synaptic activity.', 'url': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2592639/'}\n",

Reduced DAF-2 signaling leads to changes in downstream targets via the daf-16 gene, a fork-head transcription factor which is regulated by DAF-2, and results in extended life-span. Here, we describe the first identification of genes whose expression is controlled by the DAF-2 signaling cascade. dao-1, dao-2, dao-3, dao-4, dao-8 and dao-9 are down-regulated daf-2 mutant adults compared to wild-type adults, zwhereas dao-5, dao-6 and dao-7 are up-regulated. The latter genes are negatively regulated by DAF-2 signaling and positively regulated by DAF-16. Positive regulation by DAF-2 on dao-1, dao-4 and dao-8 was mediated by DAF-16, whereas daf-16 mediates only part of DAF-2 signaling for dao-2 and dao-9. Regulation by DAF-2 is most likely DAF-16 independent for dao-3 and hsp-90. RNA levels of dao-5 and dao-6 showed elevated expression in daf-2 adults, as well as being strongly expressed in dauer larvae. In contrast, hsp-90 transcript levels are low in daf-2 mutant adults though they are enriched in dauer larvae, indicating overlapping but not identical mechanisms of efficient life maintenance in stress-resistant dauer larvae and long-lived daf-2 mutant adults. dao-1, dao-8 and dao-9 are homologs of the FK506 binding proteins that interact with the mammalian insulin pathway. dao-3 encodes a putative methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase. DAO-5 shows 33% identity with human nucleolar phosphoprotein P130. dao-7 is similar to the mammalian ZFP36 protein. Distinct regulatory patterns of dao genes implicate their diverse positions within the signaling network of DAF-2 pathway, and suggest they have unique contributions to development, metabolism and longevity.\\nContent:' metadata={'source': '/Users/dan/Code/Python/pub_worm/notebooks/output/PM11743719.txt', 'title': 'DAF-16-dependent and independent expression targets of DAF-2 insulin receptor-like pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans include FKBPs.', 'url': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11743719/'}\n",

      "page_content=\"Title: Caenorhabditis elegans HCF-1 Functions in Longevity Maintenance as a DAF-16 Regulator\\nAbstract:  The transcription factor DAF-16/forkhead box O (FOXO) is a critical longevity determinant in diverse organisms, however the molecular basis of how its transcriptional activity is regulated remains largely unknown. We report that the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog of host cell factor 1 (HCF-1) represents a new longevity modulator and functions as a negative regulator of DAF-16. In C. elegans, hcf-1 inactivation caused a daf-16-dependent lifespan extension of up to 40% and heightened resistance to specific stress stimuli. HCF-1 showed ubiquitous nuclear localization and physically associated with DAF-16. Furthermore, loss of hcf-1 resulted in elevated DAF-16 recruitment to the promoters of its target genes and altered expression of a subset of DAF-16-regulated genes. We propose that HCF-1 modulates C. elegans longevity and stress response by forming a complex with DAF-16 and limiting a fraction of DAF-16 from accessing its target gene promoters, and thereby regulates DAF-16-mediated transcription of selective target genes. As HCF-1 is highly conserved, our findings have important implications for aging and FOXO regulation in mammals. \\nContent: Introduction Recent studies in various model system have revealed multiple evolutionarily conserved genes and genetic pathways important for longevity [ 1  6 ]. One of the best characterized longevity determinants is the forkhead box O (FOXO) family of transcription factors, which function as major effectors of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1-like signaling (IIS) cascade. The IIS pathway is highly conserved and has been shown to modulate longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans , Drosophila , and mice [ 7 ]. Activation of the insulin/IGF receptor tyrosine kinases triggers a kinase cascade, involving the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and the serine/threonine kinases AKT-1 and AKT-2, which culminates in the cytoplasmic sequestration and inhibition of the FOXO transcription factors [ 7 ]. In addition to aging, IIS is also critical for regulating development, metabolism, and stress response. In C. elegans , reduced signaling of the IIS pathway, such as that caused by mutations in the IIS receptor daf-2 or the PI3K age-1, results in a dramatic increase in lifespan, heightened resistance to a wide variety of environmental stress stimuli, and altered metabolism and development [ 8 , 9 ]. Loss of daf-16 , the C. elegans homolog of FOXO, completely suppresses all the phenotypes associated with IIS deficiency in C. elegans [ 10  12 ], indicating daf-16 to be the major effector of IIS in worms. From C. elegans to mammals, DAF-16/FOXO is emerging as a master regulator that is capable of responding to diverse environmental stimuli and coordinating development, metabolism, and stress response [ 1 , 13 ]. In addition to the IIS pathway, DAF-16/FOXO also responds to many other signaling cascades. Recent findings reveal that different signals induce distinct modifications of DAF-16/FOXO, which can impact the expression level, subcellular localization, and/or transcriptional activities of DAF-16/FOXO, leading to expression changes of selective DAF-16/FOXO target genes and specific cellular responses [ 13 , 14 ]. Mammalian FOXOs have been shown to regulate the expression of antioxidant enzymes, gluconeogenic enzymes, cell cycle regulators, and apoptotic genes [ 13 ]. Similarly, C. elegans DAF-16 regulates the expression of a large number of target genes, including those involved in metabolism, stress response, and immunity [ 15  17 ]. DAF-16 is thought to promote survival and longevity by mounting a robust response to various stresses, infection, and toxic compounds. Therefore, the precise control of DAF-16 transcriptional activities is a key regulatory step for longevity determination. Similar to other DNA binding transcription factors, one way for DAF-16/FOXO to achieve specificity in gene regulation depends on its functional interactions with transcriptional co-regulators. Recent findings have revealed several nuclear factors that cooperate with DAF-16/FOXO to regulate gene expression. In mammals, FOXOs can be deacetylated by the protein deacetylase SIRT1 [ 18  22 ]. SIRT1-mediated deacetylation leads to promotion of FOXO activation of stress response genes and concurrent inhibition of FOXO-regulated apoptotic genes [ 18 ]. Interestingly, SIRT1 homologs in yeast ( Sir2 ), C. elegans ( sir-2.1 ), and Drosophila ( dSir2 ) are important longevity determinants as their over-expression results in longevity increase [ 23 ]. In C. elegans , SIR-2.1 forms a protein complex with DAF-16 [ 24 , 25 ] and requires DAF-16 activity to modulate lifespan [ 26 ]. Furthermore, the nuclear factor SMK-1 and the -catenin homolog BAR-1 have recently been shown to promote DAF-16-mediated transcription [ 27 , 28 ]. C. elegans lacking smk-1 or bar-1 show shortened lifespan, similar to that of worms lacking daf-16 . BAR-1 cooperates with DAF-16 to elicit proper oxidative stress response [ 28 ], and SMK-1 is important for the roles of DAF-16 in both lifespan modulation and specific stress response [ 27 ]. Whereas SIR-2.1, SMK-1, and BAR-1 represent putative positive regulators of DAF-16 in C. elegans , nuclear factors that negatively regulate DAF-16 are largely unknown. Since DNA binding transcription factors are often regulated by the interplay between positive and negative regulators, the characterization of DAF-16 negative regulators will be essential for the further elucidation of DAF-16 regulation. In this paper, we report that the C. elegans homolog of host cell factor 1 (HCF-1) represents a new longevity determinant and functions as a negative regulator of DAF-16. HCF-1 belongs to a family of highly conserved proteins [ 29 ]. Loss of hcf-1 in C. elegans induces substantial lifespan extension of up to 40% and robust resistance to specific stress stimuli. For hcf-1 to modulate lifespan and stress response, it requires the activity of daf-16 . In delineating the mechanism by which HCF-1 regulates DAF-16, we found HCF-1 to be a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein that physically associates with DAF-16. Moreover, loss of hcf-1 led to increased recruitment of some DAF-16 to its target gene promoters and altered expression of a subset of DAF-16-regulated genes. Given the genetic and biochemical data, we propose that HCF-1 modulates lifespan and stress responses by forming a complex with DAF-16 and restricting the recruitment of a fraction of DAF-16 to its target gene promoters, thereby regulating DAF-16-mediated transcription of specific target genes. Considering that HCF-1 and DAF-16 are both highly conserved through evolution, our findings suggest that HCF-1 likely also regulates FOXO activities and is important for aging in diverse organisms. Results hcf-1 Is a Novel Longevity Gene In a recent genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen for new longevity genes [ 30 ], we found that RNAi knock down of the hcf-1 gene consistently caused C. elegans to live 20%30% longer than control RNAi treated worms ( Figure 1 A; Table 1 ). C. elegans hcf-1 encodes a protein that is highly conserved through evolution, but its biological function is just beginning to be elucidated. Mammalian HCF-1 was first identified to be the host cell factor essential for stabilizing the transcriptional complex involving the herpes simplex virus (HSV) VP-16 transcription factor [ 29 ]. Mammalian HCF-1 has subsequently been shown to play key roles in cell cycle progression, both at the G1/S transition, and at M phase and cytokinesis [ 31  33 ]. In eliciting its diverse biological roles, mammalian HCF-1 acts by binding to and regulating many different transcription and chromatin factors and assembling appropriate protein complexes for context-dependent gene expression regulation [ 29 ]. C. elegans HCF-1 has been shown to complement some of the transcriptional role of mammalian HCF-1 [ 34 ] and to also be required for proper cell cycle progression in worms ( Figure S2 ) [ 35 ]. Our data ascribe a new longevity function for HCF-1. To further investigate a role of hcf-1 in C. elegans longevity, we obtained two mutant alleles ( ok559 and pk924 ) [ 35 ] of hcf-1 and examined their lifespan. The hcf-1(ok559) mutant has an in-frame deletion that should truncate the N-terminal half of the protein, and the hcf-1(pk924) mutant has a large deletion that should result in a frame shift leading to an early stop codon, and likely represents a null mutant ( Figure S1 ) [ 35 ]. As expected on the basis of our observation with the hcf-1 RNAi worms, we detected up to 40% lifespan extension in the hcf-1 mutants compared to wild-type worms ( Figure 1 B; Table 1 ). In general, the hcf-1(pk924) mutant lives slightly longer than the hcf-1(ok559) mutant ( Table 1 ), consistent with the possibility that the pk924 allele is a more severe mutation. We confirmed that the prolonged lifespan associated with the hcf-1 mutants is due to hcf-1 deficiency by demonstrating that expression of a C-terminal green fluorescent protein (gfp)-tagged hcf-1 transgene ( hcf-1::gfp ) was able to partially restore normal lifespan in the hcf-1(pk924) mutant ( Table S2 ). Figure 1 hcf-1 Modulates Lifespan by Acting Upstream of daf-16 , but in Parallel to the IIS and Germline Signaling Pathways Lifespan of (A) wild-type worms treated with hcf-1 RNAi, (B) the hcf-1(ok559) and hcf-1(pk924) deletion mutants, (C) the daf-16(mgDf47);hcf-1(pk924) double mutant, (D) the daf-2(e1370);hcf-1(pk924) double mutant, (E) the age-1(mg44);hcf-1(ok559) double mutant, (F) the glp-1(e2141);hcf-1(pk924) double mutant worms. Each of the lifespan experiments was repeated at least two independent times with similar results. Data from representative experiments are shown. Quantitative data and statistical analyses for the experiments shown here are included in Table 1 . Table 1 Inactivation of hcf-1 Results in Lifespan Increase That Is Completely Dependent on daf-16 , but Likely Independent of the IIS and Germline Pathways HCF-1 Is Ubiquitously Expressed and Localizes to the Nucleus To further characterize HCF-1 in C. elegans , we examined the expression pattern of HCF-1 in worms. Using an affinity-purified polyclonal HCF-1 antibody in immunostaining assays, we observed prominent HCF-1 staining in the nuclei of most, if not all, somatic and germline cells in wild-type worms ( Figure 2 ). The HCF-1 expression pattern detected in wild-type worms is highly specific because the hcf-1(pk924) and hcf-1(ok559) mutants only showed background fluorescence when they were examined using identical immunostaining conditions ( Figure 2 ) (unpublished data). The nuclear localization of HCF-1 was consistently observed from embryo through larval and adult stages ( Figure 2 ) (unpublished data) [ 35 ]. Moreover, we observed similar ubiquitous nuclear expression in worms expressing a low-copy number of a functional hcf-1::gfp transgene ( Figure S3 ). Our results indicate that HCF-1 is ubiquitously expressed in the nucleus of C. elegans under normal culture condition. Mammalian HCF-1 is also predominantly a nuclear protein [ 36 ] and its nuclear localization is thought to be important for its role in gene expression regulation. Figure 2 HCF-1 Is a Ubiquitously Expressed Nuclear Protein (A) Gravid adults of wild-type and hcf-1(pk924);sur-5::gfp mutant worms were immunostained using an affinity-purified HCF-1 antibody. To ensure identical staining conditions, worms from both strains were processed on the same slide. The hcf-1(pk924) mutants were marked by SUR-5::GFP to distinguish them from wild-type worms. Endogenous HCF-1 was found to localize in the nucleus of most, if not all, somatic and germline cells in wild-type worms. The hcf-1(pk924) mutant worms marked by SUR-5::GFP showed only background signal. DAPI staining was used to indicate the nucleus. Photos were taken at 200 magnification. (B) A magnified image of the head region of the wild-type worm shown in (A). hcf-1 Modulates Lifespan in a daf-16 -Dependent Manner To characterize how hcf-1 modulates C. elegans lifespan, we asked whether hcf-1 may genetically interact with any known longevity factors in C. elegans . Because DAF-16/FOXO is one of the best characterized longevity determinants, we tested the epistatic relationship between hcf-1 and daf-16 . We created double mutants containing the hcf-1(pk924) or hcf-1(ok559) and the null daf-16(mgDf47) mutations. We found that the daf-16(mgDf47);hcf-1(pk924) or daf-16(mgDf47);hcf-1(ok559) double mutant had a lifespan indistinguishable from that of the daf-16(mgDf47) single mutant, which is 20% shorter than wild-type worms [ 37 ] ( Figure 1 C; Tables 1 and S1 ). We obtained similar results with hcf-1(ok559) mutant worms treated with daf-16 RNAi ( Table S1 ). Our results indicate that hcf-1 requires the activity of daf-16 to modulate longevity in C. elegans and suggest that hcf-1 may be a novel upstream regulator of daf-16 . hcf-1 Likely Acts in Parallel to the IIS and Germline Pathways to Modulate Lifespan Given the epistatic relationship between hcf-1 and daf-16 , we wondered whether hcf-1 modulates C. elegans lifespan by functioning in the IIS pathway, a well-established upstream regulator of daf-16 . To test this, we examined the genetic interactions between hcf-1 and two major components of the IIS pathway: daf-2 /insulin/IGF receptor and age-1 /PI3K. We reasoned that if hcf-1 normally affects C. elegans lifespan by acting in the IIS pathway, then loss of hcf-1 would not have a major impact on the longevity of worms already lacking IIS signaling. We created double mutants containing the hcf-1(pk924) or hcf-1(ok559) and either the daf-2(e1370) or the age-1(mg44) mutations. Consistent with previous findings [ 11 ], the daf-2(e1370) temperature-sensitive mutant showed an 2-fold increase in lifespan compared to wild-type worms at the nonpermissive temperature 25 C ( Figure 1 D; Tables 1 and S1 ). Interestingly, the daf-2(e1370);hcf-1(pk924) or daf-2(e1370);hcf-1(ok559) double mutant lived considerably longer than either the daf-2(e1370) or hcf-1(pk924) or hcf-1(ok559) single mutant ( Figure 1 D; Tables 1 and S1 ), and exhibited a lifespan increase that is greater than the sum of the effect for the two single mutations. We obtained similar results with the age-1(mg44);hcf-1(ok559) double mutant. age-1(mg44) is a null mutant and, when maintained as a homozygous strain, exhibits an unconditional dauer arrest phenotype [ 10 , 38 ]. To avoid this, we collected age-1(mg44) or age-1(mg44);hcf-1(ok559) homozygous mutant adults born from age-1(mg44) /+ or age-1(mg44) /+; hcf-1(ok559) parents for lifespan analysis. These age-1(mg44) and hcf-1(ok559) ; age-1(mg44) worms completely lacked zygotic age-1 expression; however, they inherited sufficient maternal age-1 message to develop normally [ 38 ]. Similar to previous results [ 38 ], the age-1(mg44) zygotic null mutant worms lived much longer than wild-type worms ( Figure 1 E; Table 1 ). The age-1(mg44);hcf-1(ok559) double mutant worms lived considerably longer than either the age-1(mg44) or hcf-1(ok559) single mutant ( Figure 1 E; Table 1 ), and exhibited a lifespan increase that is even greater than the sum of the effect for the single mutations. RNAi knock down of daf-2 or age-1 in the hcf-1(ok559) mutant gave similar results ( Table S1 ). The genetic results described here indicate that loss of hcf-1 and loss of IIS act synergistically to extend lifespan in C. elegans and suggest that hcf-1 likely functions in a pathway in parallel to IIS. Although the hcf-1(pk924) mutation is a putative null mutation, the daf-2(e1370) mutation is a temperature sensitive mutation, and a small amount of maternal AGE-1 protein may have persisted in the age-1(mg44);hcf-1(ok559) double mutant, it remains possible that loss of hcf-1 increases lifespan by further decreasing daf-2 signaling. Since germline proliferation has been implicated in C. elegans lifespan modulation, we wondered whether the extended lifespan of the hcf-1 mutant is related to the brood size defect of this mutant ( Figure S2 ) [ 35 ]. In this regard, we tested the lifespan of the double mutant glp-1(e2141);hcf-1(pk924) . The glp-1(e2141) mutant completely lacks germline cells at the nonpermissive temperature 25 C and is long-lived [ 39 ]. If the hcf-1 mutant is long-lived due to its partial defect in germline proliferation, then we would expect hcf-1 deficiency not to affect the lifespan of worms completely lacking germline cells. We found that the glp-1(e2141);hcf-1(pk924) double mutant lived much longer than the glp-1(e2141) or hcf-1(pk924) single mutants at 25 C ( Figure 1 F; Table 1 ). Therefore, loss of hcf-1 can continue to extend the lifespan of worms that completely lack germline cells and are sterile, suggesting that hcf-1 has a function in lifespan modulation that is beyond its role in germline and brood size regulation. Loss of hcf-1 Promotes Resistance to Specific Environmental Stress Since DAF-16/FOXO is well known to regulate stress responses [ 5 , 40 , 41 ], we tested whether the hcf-1 mutants may exhibit differential response to environmental stress stimuli. To assay for a response to acute oxidative stress, we challenged wild-type or hcf-1 mutant adult worms with a high-dose of paraquat, a superoxide-inducing agent, and monitored their survival. We found that the hcf-1(pk924) mutant worms were considerably more resistant to the paraquat treatment compared to wild-type worms at multiple time points throughout the experiment ( Figure 3 A). Moreover, the paraquat resistance of the hcf-1(pk924) mutants was dependent on daf-16 , as the daf-16(mgDf47);hcf-1(pk924) double mutant was sensitive to paraquat, similar to that of the daf-16(mgDf47) single mutant ( Figure 3 B). Interestingly, the hcf-1(ok559) mutant worms had survival kinetics very similar to that of wild-type worms in the paraquat assay, suggesting that the hcf-1(ok559) mutant, while long-lived, was not more resistant to a high dose of paraquat treatment compared to wild-type worms. No HCF-1 protein is detected in the hcf-1(pk924) mutant, whereas some truncated protein accumulates in the hcf-1(ok559) mutant ( Figure S1 ). Therefore, it is possible that resistance to a high level of oxidative stress only becomes apparent when HCF-1 is completely lost. Figure 3 Loss of hcf-1 Results in Heightened Resistance to Specific Environmental Stresses (A) The hcf-1(pk924) mutant worms exhibited increased survival in 200-mM paraquat compared to wild-type worms. (B) The enhanced paraquat resistance of hcf-1(pk924) was dependent on daf-16 . (C) The hcf-1(pk924) mutant worms showed increased survival in CdCl 2 (18mM) that was daf-16 dependent. (D) The hcf-1(pk924) and hcf-1(ok559) mutants and wild-type worms showed similar survival kinetics when cultured at 35 C. The age-1(hx546) and daf-16(mgDf47) worms were included as controls as they have been previously reported to be either resistant or sensitive to paraquat, heavy metal, or heat shock, respectively [ 41  43 ]. For the stress assays, duplicate to quadruplicate samples were examined for each strain. Mean fraction alive indicates the average survival among the multiplicates and error bars represent the standard deviation of the multiplicates. p -Value was calculated using Student's t -test. *, p < 0.05 when compared to wild-type (wt). **, p < 0.05 when compared to hcf-1(pk924) . Each of the stress assays was repeated at least two independent times with similar results, and the data of representative experiments are shown. To assay for a response to heavy metal stress, we challenged wild-type or hcf-1 mutant adult worms with cadmium [ 42 ] and monitored their survival. Similar to that observed with the paraquat assay, the hcf-1(pk924) mutant worms were more resistant to the cadmium exposure compared to wild-type worms at multiple time points ( Figure 3 C). The cadmium resistance of the hcf-1(pk924) mutant was also daf-16 -dependent ( Figure 3 C). To assay for a response to heat stress, we shifted adult wild-type and hcf-1 mutant worms to 35 C and monitored their survival. We found that the hcf-1 mutants and wild-type worms behaved very similarly throughout the time course of the heat shock treatment ( Figure 3 D). As previously reported [ 43 ], the age-1(hx546) mutant worms survived much longer and the daf-16(mgDf47) mutant worms died much faster than wild-type worms at 35 C. We therefore concluded that loss of hcf-1 did not result in altered response to acute heat shock. Taken together, our results indicate that loss of hcf-1 results in worms that are resistant to paraquat and cadmium exposure, but not to heat shock, suggesting that hcf-1 is required for specific stress response. Considering that DAF-16 also plays a key role in dauer formation and fat metabolism in C. elegans [ 10 , 44 , 45 ], we tested whether the hcf-1 mutants exhibit any dauer or fat phenotypes. We found that the hcf-1(ok559) mutant exhibits no dauer phenotype, whereas the hcf-1(pk924) null mutant exhibits a weak dauer exit phenotype. When monitored at 25 C, a typical temperature for testing a strong dauer phenotype, both hcf-1 mutants developed normally, whereas the daf-2(e1370) mutant formed 100% dauer ( Table 2 ). When monitored at 27 C, a temperature commonly used to test for a weak dauer formation phenotype, neither hcf-1 mutant behaved differently from wild-type worms ( Table 2 ). Lastly, we tested the daf-2;hcf-1 double mutants at 22 C, which represents a well-established sensitized condition [ 46 ] for assaying a weak dauer recovery phenotype. Single and double mutant worms harboring the daf-2(e1370) mutation were incubated at the semi-nonpermissive temperature of 22 C. Under this condition, the daf-2(ts) worms enter dauer for 3 d and then recover to become reproductive adults. We found that the hcf-1(pk924) mutation prevented dauer exit, whereas the hcf-1(ok559) mutation had no effect ( Table 2 ). These results indicate that loss of hcf-1 is associated with a weak dauer phenotype. Using the vital dye Nile Red, which stains lipid droplets in worms and represents a sensitive way to monitor fat storage [ 47 ], we did not detect any substantial differences in fat storage between hcf-1 mutants and wild-type worms ( Figure S4 ). Table 2 Inactivation of hcf-1 Results in a Weak Dauer Exit Phenotype. HCF-1 Regulates the Expression of a Subset of DAF-16 Regulated Genes Our genetic data suggest that hcf-1 acts upstream of daf-16 to affect C. elegans lifespan and stress responses. Since increased DAF-16 nuclear localization and transcriptional activities have been shown to extend lifespan in C. elegans , we tested whether HCF-1 may regulate the localization, expression level, and/or transcriptional activities of DAF-16. Using transgenic worms expressing GFP-fused DAF-16 to monitor the subcellular localization of DAF-16, we did not detect any altered DAF-16 localization in hcf-1 -deficient worms ( Figure 4 A). Using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunoblotting to examine the RNA and protein expression levels of daf-16 and the major components of the IIS pathway, including daf-2 , age-1 , and akt-1 , we observed no obvious differences in their expression levels in the hcf-1(ok559) and hcf-1(pk924) mutants compared to wild-type worms ( Figure 4 B) (unpublished data). Taken together, our results suggest that HCF-1 is not likely to affect the subcellular localization or the expression level of DAF-16. Figure 4 Loss of hcf-1 Does Not Result in Altered DAF-16 Subcellular Localization or a Change in DAF-16 Expression Level (A) Transgenic worms over-expressing DAF-16::GFP ( daf-16(mgDf47);xrIs87 ) were treated with empty vector L4440 control RNAi, hcf-1 RNAi, or daf-2 RNAi at 16 C for 5 d. DAF-16::GFP exhibited diffuse expression pattern in both the control RNAi and the hcf-1 RNAi knock down worms. hcf-1 RNAi was able to substantially reduce HCF-1 levels (bottom right panel). daf-2 RNAi was included as a positive control as it is known to stimulate robust nuclear localization of DAF-16::GFP. Photos showed the DAF-16::GFP expression pattern and DIC images of live day 2 gravid adults. Nuclear localization was verified using DIC. A total of 6070 worms were scored, and the percentage of worms showing DAF-16::GFP nuclear localization was shown in the photo. Worm extracts made from the DAF-16::GFP worms treated with control or hcf-1 RNAi were immunoblotted using anti-HCF-1 antibody ([A], bottom right panels). (B) The RNA levels of daf-16 , daf-2 , age-1 , and akt-1 in wild-type, hcf-1(ok559) , and hcf-1(pk924) worms were quantified using qRT-PCR. The data for three independent experiments were pooled, and the mean normalized RNA level and standard error of the mean (SEM) for each gene in the hcf-1 mutant and wild-type worms are shown. act-1 was used as an internal control, and the RNA level of each gene was normalized to the act-1 level. The mean normalized RNA level for each gene in wild-type (wt) worms was set as 1. None of the genes tested showed any significant expression change in the hcf-1 mutants compared to wild-type worms. To test whether HCF-1 may affect the transcriptional activities of DAF-16, we measured the message levels of DAF-16-regulated genes in the hcf-1 mutant and wild-type worms using qRT-PCR. sod-3 , which encodes an iron/manganese superoxide dismutase, is one of the best characterized DAF-16 target genes [ 17 , 40 ] and its transcription is directly up-regulated by DAF-16 [ 48 ]. Interestingly, we found that the RNA level of endogenous sod-3 was significantly elevated 34-fold in both the hcf-1(ok559) and hcf-1(pk924) mutants as compared to wild-type worms ( Figure 5 A). The elevated expression of sod-3 in the hcf-1 mutant worms is completely dependent on daf-16 because in the daf-16(mgDf47);hcf-1(ok559) double mutant, the level of sod-3 expression remained low and was similar to that seen in the daf-16(mgDf47) single mutant worms ( Figure 5 A). In corroboration of our qRT-PCR results, we observed elevated levels of GFP expression in Psod-3::gfp transgenic worms, which express a GFP reporter driven by the sod-3 promoter, in hcf-1(pk924) mutant background ( Figure S5 ). Figure 5 Loss of hcf-1 Promotes the DAF-16 Transcriptional Regulation of Several Target Genes (A) The expression of sod-3 , mtl-1 , and F21F3.3 was elevated and that of C32H11.4 was repressed in the hcf-1 mutants.

The quantitative data are summarized in Tables 3  5 . The RNA levels of sod-3 , mtl-1 , F21F3.3 , and C32H11.4 were quantified using qRT-PCR and normalized to the internal control act-1 . The data for at least three independent experiments were pooled, and the mean normalized RNA level and SEM for each gene in the indicated strains are shown. The mean normalized RNA level for each gene in wt worms was set as 1. p -Value was calculated using Student's t -test. For sod-3 or mtl-1 expression, we analyzed for a synergistic effect in daf-2(e1370);hcf-1(pk924) compared to daf-2(e1370) or hcf-1(pk924) using two-way ANOVA analysis. Table 3 Inactivation of hcf-1 Results in Significant Expression Changes of a Subset of DAF-16 Regulated Genes To investigate whether hcf-1 may generally affect the transcriptional activities of DAF-16, we surveyed additional DAF-16-regulated genes as reported in previous microarray studies [ 17 ]. The previous studies have focused on DAF-16 targets that are responsive to IIS and we verified that all the genes we chose to test exhibit daf-2/daf-16 responsiveness under our assaying conditions ( Table 3 ). Among the 11 DAF-16-activated genes examined, we found that in addition to sod-3 , the expression levels of mtl-1 , which encodes a metallothionein, and F21F3.3 , which encodes an farnesyl cysteine-carboxyl methyltransferase, showed a statistically significant, greater than 2-fold up-regulation in the hcf-1 mutants compared to wild-type worms ( Figure 5 A; Table 3 ). The elevated expression of mtl-1 in hcf-1 mutant worms is completely dependent on daf-16 ( Figure 5 A; Table 4 ) and that of F21F3.3 is partially dependent on daf-16 ( Figure 5 A; Table 4 ). Among the six DAF-16-repressed genes examined, we found that the expression level of C32H11.4 , which encodes a protein of unknown function, showed a statistically significant, greater than 2-fold down-regulation in the hcf-1 mutants compared to wild-type worms ( Figure 5 A; Table 3 ). Similar to that of F21F3.3 , the repressed expression of C32H11.4 is partially dependent on daf-16 ( Figure 5 A; Table 4 ). The partial dependency suggests that additional factors might cooperate with DAF-16 to regulate F21F3.3 and C32H11.4 expression in the hcf-1 mutants. Table 4 Expression Changes of Several HCF-1 Regulated Genes Are daf-16 Dependent We also noticed that the expression of hsp-16.1 , which encodes a heat shock protein, and fat-5 , which encodes a delta-9 fatty acid desaturase, was significantly up-regulated and repressed, respectively, in the hcf-1 mutants ( Table 3 ). However, the altered expression of fat-5 and hsp-16.1 in the hcf-1 mutants did not require daf-16 (unpublished data). These results suggest that although hsp-16.1 and fat-5 are robust DAF-16 targets in response to daf-2 signaling ( Table 3 ), they do not appear to be significantly regulated by DAF-16 in response to hcf-1 deficiency. Moreover, whereas fat-5 is activated by DAF-16 in response to reduced daf-2 signaling, its expression was repressed in the hcf-1 mutant in a daf-16 -independent manner. Many of the DAF-16 downstream genes we surveyed are likely regulated by multiple different transcription factors. For example, hsp-16.1 is likely also regulated by the heat shock factor HSF-1. It is possible that in the hcf-1 mutants, different transcription factor(s) play a major role in mediating the expression change of hsp-16.1 and fat-5 , and DAF-16 only plays a minor role or is not involved in their gene expression regulation. The expression of the remaining DAF-16 target genes either did not show a significant change in the hcf-1 mutants, or their expression change was less than 2-fold. Consistent with our genetic data in which hcf-1 appears to act in parallel to daf-2 signaling to affect lifespan, the expression of sod-3 and mtl-1 was synergistically up-regulated in the daf-2(e1370);hcf-1(pk924) double mutant compared to either daf-2(e1370) or hcf-1(pk924) single mutant ( Figure 5 B; Table 5 ). Taken together, our results suggest that hcf-1 is only able to affect the expression of selective DAF-16 target genes. Moreover, our data indicate that hcf-1 inactivation leads to daf-16 -dependent up-regulation of three different DAF-16 activated genes and daf-16 -dependent down-regulation of a DAF-16 repressed gene, suggesting that hcf-1 normally participates in the inhibition of DAF-16 transcriptional activity. Importantly, the dependence of hcf-1 on daf-16 to elicit gene expression changes correlates with the requirement of daf-16 in hcf-1 -mediated lifespan modulation, suggesting that the ability of HCF-1 to regulate DAF-16 transcriptional activity is likely linked to its role in longevity. Considering that C. elegans HCF-1 is normally localized to the nucleus, and that its mammalian homolog has a known role in gene expression regulation, we hypothesize that HCF-1 modulates C. elegans lifespan by regulating the transcriptional activity of DAF-16 at a subset of target genes that are particularly important for stress response and longevity assurance. Table 5 Inactivation of hcf-1 and daf-2 Results in Synergistic Regulation of Some DAF-16 Target Genes HCF-1 Forms a Protein Complex with DAF-16 We next examined how HCF-1 might affect the transcriptional activity of DAF-16. In mammalian cells, HCF-1 is thought to regulate gene expression by binding to various transcription and chromatin factors [ 33 , 49  51 ]. In C. elegans , DAF-16 localizes to both cytoplasm and nucleus under normal culture condition, and HCF-1 appears predominantly nuclear in most cells ( Figure 2 ) [ 35 , 37 , 52 ], suggesting that DAF-16 and HCF-1 co-localize in the nucleus ( Figure S6 ). We therefore tested whether C. elegans HCF-1 may physically associate with DAF-16. Since we did not have an antibody that could detect endogenous DAF-16 robustly, we performed co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments using worm strains that lack endogenous DAF-16, but carry in low-copy number a functional gfp-fused daf-16 transgene ( daf-16(mu86);muIs71 ) [ 37 ]. We found that when an affinity-purified HCF-1 antibody was used to immunoprecipitate HCF-1 from extracts of the daf-16::gfp transgenic worms, DAF-16::GFP was co-immunoprecipitated ( Figure 6 B). This interaction appeared specific because when co-IP experiments were done using extracts of daf-16::gfp worms that also harbor the hcf-1(ok559) deletion ( daf-16(mu86);hcf-1(ok559);muIs71 ), we were not able to immunoprecipitate HCF-1 or to co-immunoprecipitate DAF-16::GFP ( Figure 6 B). Furthermore, using identical co-IP conditions, we did not recover the irrelevant Psod-3::GFP (a GFP reporter driven by the sod-3 promoter) upon HCF-1 immunoprecipitation, indicating that the proteinprotein interaction detected between DAF-16::GFP and HCF-1 is not likely mediated by the GFP tag. We obtained similar results using reciprocal co-IP experiments ( Figure 6 A). Our results suggest that HCF-1 is able to form a specific protein complex with DAF-16 in C. elegans . Figure 6 HCF-1 Forms a Protein Complex with DAF-16 in C. elegans Worm extracts were made from mixed stage worms and subjected to immunoprecipitation. Extracts from wild-type (wt), Psod-3::gfp , daf-16::gfp (daf-16(mu86);muIs71) , and daf-16::gfp;hcf-1(-) (daf-16(mu86);hcf-1(ok559);muIs71) worms were either immunoprecipitated using anti-GFP antibody (A) or anti-HCF-1 antibody (B). The immunoprecipitated protein complexes were subsequently immunoblotted using anti-HCF-1, anti-DAF-16, or anti-GFP antibodies. Psod-3::gfp worms were used as a negative control to indicate that there was no interaction between the GFP tag and HCF-1. For input, 50 g of total protein was loaded per lane. For immunoprecipitation, 2 mg of total protein was used. Loss of hcf-1 Leads to Enhanced Enrichment of DAF-16 on Its Target Gene Promoters To further elucidate the molecular mechanism by which HCF-1 regulates DAF-16-mediated transcription, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments to test how HCF-1 might affect DAF-16 enrichment on target gene promoters. For the ChIP experiments, we employed daf-16::gfp worms ( daf-2(e1370);daf-16(mgDf47);daf-16::gfp ) and anti-GFP immunoprecipitation to capture DAF-16. As previously reported [ 48 ], DAF-16 was enriched at the promoter of sod-3 when the IIS pathway was inactivated ( Figure 7 A). We also examined the DAF-16 target gene mtl-1 and found that DAF-16 was enriched on its promoter ( Figure 7 A). Under the same ChIP conditions, we did not detect HCF-1 enrichment at the sod-3 or mtl-1 promoters, but detected great enrichment of HCF-1 at the promoter of efl-1 ( Figure 7 B). efl-1 is the C. elegans E2f1 gene; in mammalian cells, HCF-1 is highly enriched at the promoter region of E2f1 [ 53 ]. Thus, our results demonstrate a conserved role of HCF-1 at the efl-1 / E2f1 promoter in worms, and suggest that HCF-1 is not likely to present at sod-3 or mtl-1 promoters. Considering our co-IP results showing that HCF-1 and DAF-16 physically associate in worms ( Figure 6 ), our ChIP results suggest that the HCF-1/DAF-16 complex is probably not present at the promoters of DAF-16 target genes. However, it remains possible that HCF-1 is a component of a large protein complex that associates with DAF-16 at target gene promoters, and our cross-linking conditions cannot capture the presence of HCF-1 at those promoters. For the other hcf-1 -regulated, daf-16 -dependent genes ( Table 4 ; F21F3.3 and C32H11.4 ), we either did not identify a putative DAF-16 binding element or did not detect DAF-16 enrichment at the promoter regions we surveyed, suggesting that they might not be DAF-16 direct targets. We next tested whether the enrichment of DAF-16 on sod-3 or mtl-1 promoters would be affected when hcf-1 was RNAi depleted. As a control, we showed that the enrichment of HCF-1 on the efl-1 promoter was substantially reduced when hcf-1 was knocked down by RNAi. Interestingly, under the same RNAi conditions, we consistently observed an enhanced enrichment of DAF-16 to the sod-3 and mtl-1 promoters in multiple independent trials ( Figure 7 A). These results suggest that in the absence of HCF-1, more DAF-16 is able to localize to the promoters of its target genes. Figure 7 Loss of hcf-1 Enhances the Enrichment of DAF-16 on the Promoters of Its Target Genes ChIP was performed using daf-2(e1370);daf-16(mgDf47);daf-16::gfp worms treated with control RNAi (L4440) or hcf-1 RNAi. Synchronized adult worms of the different strains were incubated at 25 C for 6 h to inactivate daf-2 and to induce robust DAF-16::GFP nuclear localization. Worm extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-GFP, anti-HCF-1, or anti-Rabbit IgG. The recovered DNA was quantitated using qPCR. Regions around the DAF-16 binding element (DBE) at the sod-3 or mtl-1 promoters, as well as a putative noncoding region of Chromosome IV not containing any DBE were monitored. The figure shows one representative experiment. Error bars represent the SEM of the duplicated reactions in qPCR. Similar results were obtained for three independent experiments. (A) DAF-16 enrichment at the promoters of sod-3 or mtl-1 was enhanced upon hcf-1 RNAi. DAF-16 was robustly enriched at the sod-3 or mtl-1 promoters after anti-GFP ChIP compared to that of anti-Rb (anti-GFP/anti-Rabbit at sod-3 promoter: 9-fold; anti-GFP/anti-Rabbit at mtl-1 promoter: 11-fold). The fold enrichment of DAF-16 at sod-3 or mtl-1 was consistently greater than that at the nonspecific Chromosome IV region: sod-3 /chr IV: 2.9-fold; mtl-1 /chr IV: 2.4-fold. As a control, anti-GFP ChIP in wild-type (wt) worms (not expressing daf-16::gfp ) showed background signal that was very similar to that of anti-Rabbit. Upon hcf-1 RNAi knockdown, DAF-16 enrichment at the sod-3 or mtl-1 promoters was greatly increased. Anti-GFP/anti-Rabbit at sod-3 promoter: 33-fold (versus 9-fold for L4440 RNAi); anti-GFP/anti-Rabbit at mtl-1 promoter: 33-fold (versus 11-fold for L4440 RNAi). In contrast, for the nonspecific Chromosome IV region, anti-GFP/anti-Rabbit: 4-fold (versus 3-fold for L4440 RNAi). These data indicated that in the absence of HCF-1, a greater amount of DAF-16 becomes recruited to the sod-3 or mtl-1 promoters, but the nonspecific binding of DAF-16 to the Chromosome IV region is not substantially changed. (B) HCF-1 was greatly enriched at the efl-1 promoter, but not at sod-3 or mtl-1 promoters. efl-1 is the C. elegans homolog of E2f1 , which has been shown to be a direct target of HCF-1 in mammalian cells [ 53 ]. The region of the efl-1 promoter containing a conserved E2F1 binding element was included as a positive control for anti-HCF-1 ChIP. Whereas HCF-1 was found to be greatly enriched at the efl-1 promoter, it was not substantially enriched at the promoters of sod-3 or mtl-1 , or the Chromosome IV noncoding region. Fold change of anti-HCF-1/anti-Rabbit at efl-1 , sod-3 , mtl-1 , Chromosome IV noncoding region: 30.8, 2.1, 3.6, 2.3, respectively. As a control, when hcf-1 was knocked down by RNAi, the enrichment of HCF-1 on the promoter of efl-1 was greatly reduced. Discussion Our study has revealed the C. elegans homolog of HCF-1 to be an important longevity determinant and transcriptional regulator of DAF-16. Our data indicate that HCF-1 is necessary for maintaining normal lifespan and stress response in C. elegans , as loss of hcf-1 results in mutant worms with substantially extended longevity and heightened resistance to specific stress stimuli. In modulating C. elegans lifespan and stress response, hcf-1 completely depends on the activity of daf-16 , but likely acts independently of the IIS pathway. In elucidating the mechanism by which HCF-1 regulates DAF-16, we showed that HCF-1 is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein and forms a protein complex with DAF-16 in C. elegans . Interestingly, in the absence of hcf-1 , greater enrichment of DAF-16 at its target gene promoters is observed and more robust DAF-16-mediated regulation of selective transcriptional targets is detected. On the basis of our results, we propose that HCF-1 modulates C. elegans lifespan and stress response by acting as a novel negative regulator of DAF-16. Normally, HCF-1 associates with DAF-16 and limits a fraction of DAF-16 from accessing its target gene promoters. In the absence of HCF-1, more DAF-16 is released to localize to target gene promoters to confer greater transcriptional regulation of selective target genes ( Figure 8 ). Altered expression of this subset of target genes likely contributes to the stress resistance and prolonged longevity phenotypes observed in the hcf-1 mutant worms. Figure 8 The Model We propose that in wild-type C. elegans , HCF-1 associates with a fraction of DAF-16 in the nucleus and limits the recruitment of some DAF-16 to its target gene promoters. Inactivation of hcf-1 allows more DAF-16 to access its target gene promoters and enforces DAF-16-mediated regulation of selective target genes, which likely contributes to the prolonged lifespan and enhanced stress resistance phenotypes of the hcf-1 mutants. Our results ascribe a new longevity and stress response function to the highly conserved transcriptional regulator HCF-1. Mammalian HCF-1 was first identified as a major host cell factor required for HSV VP16-induced immediate early gene transcription [ 29 ]. In addition to its role in HSV infection, HCF-1 is also essential for cell cycle progression. Studies have revealed that mammalian HCF-1 is required for appropriate transition from G1 to S phase, and also proper progression of M phase and cytokinesis [ 31  33 ]. Importantly, mammalian and C. elegans HCF-1 share conserved functions. C. elegans HCF-1 is able to stabilize the VP16-induced complex; moreover, C. elegans hcf-1 mutants produce small broods and exhibit low penetrance of embryonic lethality ( Figure S2 ) [ 35 ], both phenotypes consistent with a role of HCF-1 in cell proliferation. Furthermore, C. elegans hcf-1 mutant embryos show low penetrance of mitotic and cytokinetic defects [ 35 ]. As HSV is a human specific virus, it is thought that VP16 likely mimicked a cellular interaction with HCF-1 and co-opted human HCF-1 for productive HSV lytic infection. Given the well-established and conserved role of HCF-1 in cell cycle control, it is interesting to consider whether the cell proliferation function of HCF-1 is linked to its role in longevity and stress response. In adult C. elegans , the only proliferative tissue is the germline. Whereas a defect in germline stem cell proliferation is known to cause lifespan increase, our genetic studies showed that hcf-1 deficiency can continue to extend the lifespan of worms completely lacking germline ( Figure 1 F; Table 1 ), suggesting that the longevity function of hcf-1 is likely not linked to its role in cell proliferation. The high degree of functional conservation between C. elegans and mammalian HCF-1 suggests that mammalian HCF-1 likely also participates in stress response and longevity determination. Therefore, HCF-1 may very well represent a new universal longevity determinant. Our model proposes that HCF-1 affects lifespan and stress response by forming a protein complex with DAF-16 and regulating DAF-16 recruitment to target gene promoters and DAF-16-mediated gene transcription. This model is consistent with the known roles of mammalian HCF-1. For VP16-induced immediate early (IE) gene expression, binding of HCF-1 to VP16 is thought to help recruit the activating Set1/Ash2 histone methyltransferase complex to IE-gene promoters [ 29 ]. For its role in G1/S transition, mammalian HCF-1 has been found to recruit the Set1/Ash2 histone methyltransferase activating complex to E2F1 and the Sin3 histone deacetylase repressive complex to E2F4 at the appropriate times of the cell cycle, which likely helps to reinforce the activating or repressive functions of the respective E2F family members [ 33 ]. The role of HCF-1 in regulating the transcription factor Miz-1 is particularly relevant to this study. HCF-1 has been shown to physically associate with Miz-1 and antagonize Miz-1-mediated transactivation by interfering with the association of Miz-1 and the histone deacetylase P300 [ 49 ]. Furthermore, HCF-1, via its various functional motifs, has been shown to mediate proteinprotein interactions with a large number of polypeptides, including transcription factors LZIP/Luman, Zhangfei, HPIP, Sp1, and GABP, protein phosphatase PP1, and cell-death protein PDCD2 [ 29 ]. HCF-1 is emerging as an extremely versatile scaffolding protein, capable of binding to many different transcription and chromatin factors via its different conserved motifs, and assembling appropriate protein complexes for proper context-dependent gene expression regulation [ 33 , 49  51 ]. Our qRT-PCR results suggest that HCF-1 is only able to regulate the DAF-16-mediated transcription of a select group of previously identified DAF-16 target genes. Considering that the DAF-16 target genes we surveyed were previously determined to be responsive to daf-2/IIS , and since our genetic studies suggest that hcf-1 and daf-2 might act in parallel pathways and converge onto daf-16 ( Figure 1 ), it is not surprising that some of the gene expression changes caused by hcf-1 deficiency would be distinct from that caused by reduced daf-2 signaling. It can be argued that HCF-1 might represent a weaker regulator of DAF-16 compared to DAF-2, and its effect on some of the DAF-16-regulated genes might simply be missed in our analysis as it is likely to be much weaker than that in the daf-2 mutant ( Table 3 ). Whereas a weaker effect model is possible, we favor the model that HCF-1 represents a gene-specific regulator of DAF-16. In our analysis, we noticed that the impact of hcf-1 deficiency on DAF-16 target gene regulation is not always much weaker than reduced daf-2 signaling. For instance, the expression fold change of F21F3.3 in hcf-1(-) was comparable with that in daf-2(-) (5-fold versus 11-fold). On the other hand, there are genes, e.g., dod-3 and dod-24 , whose expression change in daf-2(-) is as great as that of sod-3 or mtl-1 (100-fold), however, unlike sod-3 and mtl-1 , their gene expression did not show a significant change in hcf-1(-). Future whole genome expression profiling experiments will provide a global view of whether HCF-1 acts as a gene-specific negative regulator of DAF-16. Considering that HCF-1 and DAF-16/FOXO are highly conserved across species, it is very likely that mammalian HCF-1 also conserves the function of FOXO regulation. Whereas C. elegans only has one daf-16 gene, mammals have four FOXO genes. Context specific regulators of FOXOs are critical in ensuring specificity on gene expression regulation and subsequent biological responses [ 14 ]. Our findings in C. elegans raise the intriguing possibility that mammalian HCF-1 represents a new regulator of one or more of the FOXO proteins. An important next question is how HCF-1 might achieve its specificity in influencing DAF-16 transcriptional targets. A simple hypothesis is that the association between HCF-1 and DAF-16 may be regulated on the basis of upstream stimulus. For example, signals that induce altered subcellular localization of HCF-1 or DAF-16 may disrupt the HCF-1/DAF-16 interaction. Both HCF-1 and DAF-16 has been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm under specific conditions [ 14 , 37 , 54  56 ]. In addition, DAF-16/FOXO and HCF-1 proteins have been shown to be extensively modified post-translationally [ 14 , 37 , 52 , 57  59 ]. It is possible that different modifications on HCF-1 and/or DAF-16 will substantially affect their association. Lastly, the specificity toward target genes can also be conferred at the level of the transcriptional complex assembly. Under this scenario, additional co-regulators of DAF-16 will likely come into play. Whereas HCF-1 represents the only nuclear negative regulator of DAF-16 known in C. elegans , several DAF-16 nuclear positive regulators have been reported, including SIR-2.1 [ 24 ], SMK-1 [ 27 ], and BAR-1 [ 28 ]. Future research to elucidate the interplay among the various DAF-16 co-activators and HCF-1 will greatly advance our understanding of the mechanistic details of how DAF-16 transcriptional activities can be appropriately regulated. Our data indicate that an important function of HCF-1 may be to modulate responses to specific environmental stress stimuli. Interestingly, only the hcf-1(pk924) allele showed resistance to paraquat and cadmium treatment, and neither of the hcf-1 mutant alleles demonstrated altered response to heat shock. These results suggest that a general heightened response to a wide-range of environmental stresses is not likely to account for the lifespan increase observed in the hcf-1 mutant worms. However, it is important to also consider that in the stress assays, worms were challenged with a high dose of an acute stress, which is very different from the low level of chronic stress worms experience as they grow old in longitudinal assays. The involvement of hcf-1 in stress response nicely fits with the overall theme that HCF-1 is a gene-specific transcriptional regulator of DAF-16. It is well established that distinct stress stimuli are able to induce DAF-16/FOXO to regulate different target genes [ 13 , 14 ]. We propose that the main role of HCF-1 is to help fine tune the regulation of a subset of DAF-16-regulated genes to modulate survival under specific conditions. Taken together, we showed that HCF-1 is essential for longevity maintenance and that it functions as a negative regulator of DAF-16 in C. elegans . As HCF-1 and DAF-16/FOXO are highly conserved from C. elegans to mammals, our findings have important implications for FOXO regulation and longevity determination in diverse organisms. Materials and Methods C. elegans strains. The strains used in this paper were as follow: wild-type N2, daf-16 (mgDf47) , daf-2 (e1370) , age-1(hx546) , sqt-1(sc13) age-1(mg44)/mnC1 (a gift from Catherine A. Wolkow, National Institute of Aging), glp-1(e2141), hcf-1(ok559) (generated by the C. elegans Gene Knockout Consortium), hcf-1(pk924) (a gift from Winship Herr, University of Lausanne, Switzerland), daf-16(mgDf47);xrIs87[daf-16::gfp::daf-16b, rol-6(su1006)] (DAF-16::GFP) [ 52 ], daf-16(mu86);muIs71[daf-16a::gfp/bKO , rol-6(su1006) ] (DAF-16::GFP) [ 37 ], and muIs84[Psod-3::gfp] [ 60 ]. The hcf-1(ok559) allele was outcrossed five times and the hcf-1(pk924) allele was outcrossed three times with the N2 strain in our lab prior to phenotype analyses. The following double mutant strains were constructed using standard genetic methods: daf-16(mgDf47);hcf-1(ok559), daf-16(mgDf47);hcf-1(pk924), daf-2(e1370);hcf-1(ok559), daf-2(e1370);hcf-1(pk924), sqt-1(sc13) age-1(mg44)/mnC1;hcf-1(ok559),glp-1(e2141);hcf-1(pk924), daf-16(mu86);muIs71[daf-16a::gfp/bKO, rol-6(su1006)];hcf-1(ok559), daf-16(mu86);muIs71[daf-16a::gfp/bKO and hcf-1(pk924);sur-5::gfp, muIs84[Psod-3::gfp];hcf-1(pk924) . All strains were cultured using standard methods [ 61 ]. Unless otherwise stated, NGM plates were seeded with E. coli OP50 as the food source. Lifespan assays. For RNAi lifespan assays, RNAi bacteria were grown in Luria broth with 50 g/ml ampicillin at 37 C for 1016 h, seeded onto NGM plates containing 2 or 4 mM IPTG, and induced at room temperature for about 6 h [ 62 ]. Worms were allowed to lay eggs overnight on RNAi plates at 16 C, and the progeny were grown on RNAi plates at 25 C until they developed into young adult stage. The young adult worms were then transferred onto RNAi plates seeded with 3-fold concentrated RNAi bacteria that contained 50 g/ml FUDR to prevent the growth of progeny. For lifespan assays using NGM plates seeded with OP50 bacteria, worms were allowed to lay eggs over-night at 16 C, and the progeny were grown on NGM plates at 25 C till young adult stage. The young adult worms were then transferred onto NGM plates that contained 50 g/ml FUDR and seeded with 3-fold concentrated E. coli OP50. For lifespan assays involving daf-2(e1370) and daf-2(e1370);hcf-1(pk924) or daf-2(e1370);hcf-1(ok559) worms, progeny were allowed to grow at 16 C and shifted to 25 C after the L3 larval stage to avoid the constitutive dauer arrest phenotype associated with the daf-2(e1370) mutant [ 63 ]. For all lifespan assays, worms were aged at 25 C. Worms were scored every day or every other day, and those that failed to respond to a gentle prodding with a platinum wire were scored as dead. Animals that bagged, exploded, or crawled off the plate were considered as censored. We defined the day when we transferred the young adult worms as day 0 of adult lifespan. Statistical analysis was done using the SPSS software and p -values were calculated using the log-rank test. All the lifespan experiments were repeated at least two independent times. Transgenic animals. A GFP-fused hcf-1 plasmid ( Phcf-1 :: hcf-1::gfp ) was created by inserting a genomic fragment that contains 500 bp upstream of the predicted ATG of hcf-1 and the entire predicted coding region of hcf-1 into the pPD95_77 plasmid. Transgenic worms were created by microparticle bombardment as previously described [ 64 ]. The Phcf-1::hcf-1::gfp plasmid was co-bombarded with the pJKL702 [ unc-119(+) ] plasmid into the unc-119(ed4) mutant worms to obtain the strain unc-119(ed4);rwIs3[Phcf-1::hcf-1::gfp, unc-119] . Multiple independent integrated transgenic lines were examined. Embryonic and brood size assays. Each single L4 worm was allowed to lay eggs and transferred to a fresh NGM plate every 24 h until it completed egglay. The number of eggs laid and the number of hatched worms were counted. A total of five worms were used for each strain. Nile red staining. Nile red staining was performed as previously described [ 47 ]. Unseeded NGM plates were coated with 0.025 g/ml final concentration Nile red that had been resuspended in acetone and diluted in H 2 O. The Nile red was allowed to diffuse through NGM overnight. The plates were then seeded with OP50 bacteria and left at room temperature overnight. Gravid adult worms were allowed to egglay onto the plates overnight, and progeny allowed to develop to young adult stage. Worms were then monitored using a fluorescent microscope (Leica DM 5000B) and images were captured using a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER camera and the OpenLab Software. Stress assays. All stress assays were performed as previously described [ 41  43 ]. For the paraquat assay, gravid adult worms of each strain tested were allowed to lay egg on NGM plates seeded with OP50 for 23 h to produce relatively synchronous populations of progeny. The progeny were allowed to develop at 25 C, and when they reached young-adulthood, FUDR was added to the plates at a final concentration of 50 g/ml to prevent the growth of progeny. At day 23 of adulthood, worms were washed off the NGM plates and rinsed with M9 buffer three times to remove the OP50 bacteria. Approximately 30 adults were dispensed into each well of a 24-well culture plate containing 300 l of 200 mM paraquat (Sigma) in M9 buffer. Triplicate wells were used for each strain, and the experiment was repeated at least two independent times. Worms in the paraquat buffer were scored every 23 h for survival. Worms that failed to respond to gentle prodding were scored as dead. For the CdCl 2 assay, synchronized day 2 adult worms were collected as described above and washed by K-medium. Worms were then put into each well of a 24-well culture plate containing 600 l K-medium with 18 mM CdCl 2 at 20 C. Triplicate plates for each strain were scored for each time point indicated. Worms that failed to respond to gentle prodding were scored as dead. For the heat shock assay, synchronous populations of worms were grown as described above. Day 2 adult worms grown on OP50-NGM plates were shifted to 35 C. Duplicate or triplicate plates for each strain were scored for each time point. Because the scoring was done at room temperature, once the worms were pulled from 35 C and scored for survival, they were discarded to avoid the complication of recovery from heat shock during the time of scoring. Dauer assays. Dauer assays were performed as previously described [ 46 ]. Worms at the L4 stage were allowed to lay egg at16 C over night. The resulting progeny were allowed to develop at the indicated temperature. At 96 h (25 C or 27 C) or 120 h (22 C) after egg lay, the number of dauers and adult worms on each plate were scored. Replica plates were scored for each strain. The dauer assays were repeated two to three times. DAF-16::GFP localization assay. daf-16(mgDf47);xrls87 transgenic strain was used for DAF-16::GFP localization assay [ 52 ]. Worms at the L4 larval stage were picked onto RNAi plates and allowed to lay egg at 16 C for one day. Progenies were exposed to the RNAi bacteria at 16 C for 5 d until they became gravid adults. The DAF-16::GFP signal was then monitored using a fluorescent microscope (Leica DM 5000B), and images were captured using a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER camera and the OpenLab program. Immunostaining. Worm fixation and immunostaining were performed as previously described [ 65 ]. In brief, worms were immobilized and compressed between two polylysine coated slides and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. The cuticle was removed by quickly separating two frozen slides. Worms were then quickly fixed in pre-chilled methanol at 20 C. Incubation with primary and secondary antibodies and washes were done in TBS buffer at room temperature. Fluorescence signal was monitored using a fluorescent microscope (Leica DM 5000B), and images were captured using a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER camera and the OpenLab program. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were carried out as described [ 66 ]. In brief, for immunoprecipitation experiments, worm extracts were made from mixed staged worms by sonication of worms in lysis buffer and subsequent removal of debris by centrifugation. The appropriate antibody was incubated with worm extract at 4 C overnight followed by incubation with protein A slurry (Pierce) at 4 C for 36 hrs. The protein A beads were then washed with lysis buffer for 6 times. The bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 2 sample buffer, separated on a SDS gel, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and followed by standard ECL detection. Antibodies. To generate polyclonal antiserum against C. elegans HCF-1, bacterial recombinant S-tagged fusion protein containing full-length HCF-1 was purified using the S-Tag Thrombin Purification kit (Novagen) and used as an antigen to immunize guinea pigs. The crude anti-HCF-1 antiserum was subsequently purified using S-tagged HCF-1. In brief, the crude anti-HCF-1 antiserum was incubated with purified S-tagged HCF-1 immobilized on nitrocellulose membrane (BA85 Protran BioScience). Poorly bound proteins were removed by multiple washes in TBS and PBS buffer, and the bound anti-HCF-1 antibody was recovered by subsequent elution. For immunostaining, affinity purified anti-HCF-1 antibody was used as the primary antibody (1:500) and anti-guinea pig conjugated with Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, 1:200) was used as the secondary antibody. For GFP immunostaining, anti-GFP (goat, Rockland) was used as the primary antibody (1:1000) and anti-goat conjugated with FITC (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, 1:400) was used as the secondary antibody. For immunoprecipitation, affinity purified anti-HCF-1 and anti-GFP (rabbit, Clontech) antibodies were used. Antibodies for immunoblotting include: anti-DAF-16 (cC-20) (goat, Santa Cruz), anti-HCF-1, anti-GFP (rabbit, Clontech), anti-ACTIN (mouse, Chemicon), anti-goat (Rockland), anti-mouse (Santa Cruz), anti-guinea pig (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), and anti-rabbit (Rockland). RNA isolation and qRT-PCR. Synchronized late L4 staged worms were used for RNA isolation. All the worms for qRT-PCR were grown at 25 C except that in the experiments using daf-2(e1370) mutants, worms were shifted from 16 C to 25 C for 8 h prior to harvest. Total RNA from 1015 l of worm pellet was isolated using Tri-reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc.) [ 67 ]. cDNAs were synthesized with random hexamers using SuperScript III First-Strand Kit (Invitrogen). qRT-PCR reactions were performed using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (BIO-RAD) and the MyiQ Single Color Real-time PCR Detection System (BIO-RAD). The qRT-PCR conditions were: 95 C for 3 min, followed by a 40-cycles of 10 s at 95 C and 30 s at 60 C. Melting curve analysis was performed for each primer set at the end to ensure the specificity of the amplified product. For qRT-PCR, act-1 was used as the internal control, and the RNA level of each gene of interest was normalized to the level of act-1 for comparison. The qRT-PCR experiment was repeated at least three times using independent RNA/cDNA preparations. The data were pooled and analyzed using Student's t -test. qRT-PCR primers.

These pathways were defined by mutants that form dauers constitutively (Daf-c) at 25 degrees. Screens for Daf-c mutants at 25 degrees have probably been saturated, but failed to identify all the components involved in regulating dauer formation. Here we screen for Daf-c mutants at 27 degrees, a more strongly dauer-inducing condition. Mutations identified include novel classes of alleles for three known genes and alleles defining at least seven new genes, hid-1-hid-7. Many of the genes appear to act in the insulin branch of the dauer pathway, including pdk-1, akt-1, aex-6, and hid-1. We also molecularly identify hid-1 and show that it encodes a novel highly conserved putative transmembrane protein expressed in neurons. \\nContent:' metadata={'source': '/Users/dan/Code/Python/pub_worm/notebooks/output/PMC1462745.txt', 'title': 'Isolation and characterization of high-temperature-induced Dauer formation mutants in Caenorhabditis elegans.', 'url': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1462745/'}\n",
      "page_content='Title:TIR-1/SARM1 inhibits axon regeneration and promotes axon degeneration\\nAbstract:  Growth and destruction are central components of the neuronal injury response. Injured axons that are capable of repair, including axons in the mammalian peripheral nervous system and in many invertebrate animals, often regenerate and degenerate on either side of the injury. Here we show that TIR-1/dSarm/SARM1, a key regulator of axon degeneration, also inhibits regeneration of injured motor axons. The increased regeneration in tir-1 mutants is not a secondary consequence of its effects on degeneration, nor is it determined by the NADase activity of TIR-1. Rather, we found that TIR-1 functions cell-autonomously to regulate each of the seemingly opposite processes through distinct interactions with two MAP kinase pathways. On one side of the injury, TIR-1 inhibits axon regeneration by activating the NSY-1/ASK1 MAPK signaling cascade, while on the other side of the injury, TIR-1 simultaneously promotes axon degeneration by interacting with the DLK-1 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade. In parallel, we found that the ability to cell-intrinsically inhibit axon regeneration is conserved in human SARM1. Our finding that TIR-1/SARM1 regulates axon regeneration provides critical insight into how axons coordinate a multidimensional response to injury, consequently informing approaches to manipulate the response toward repair. \\nContent: Introduction In many injured neurons that are capable of repair, axons are broken into fragments with different fates. The axon segment that remains attached to the cell body regenerates and severed axon segments degenerate. However, in the central nervous system and in aged animals, regeneration of the proximal axon fragment is inhibited, resulting in a permanent loss of neuronal function ( Cai et al., 2001 ; David and Aguayo, 1981 ). Understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate both axon regeneration and degeneration is critical to developing therapeutic approaches to repair the injured nervous system. On the proximal side of the injury, functional axon regeneration requires the synchronized execution of multiple processes, including growth cone formation, axon guidance, and synapse formation. Despite being recapitulations of well-characterized developmental processes, the precise molecular mechanisms that regulate axon regeneration remain incompletely understood. Those that have been identified are subdivided into two broad categories: intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic regulators of transcription, transport, translation, and signaling are complemented and opposed by extrinsic regulators of myelin-dependent inhibition and scar formation ( He and Jin, 2016 ; Kaplan et al., 2015 ; Mahar and Cavalli, 2018 ; Schwab and Strittmatter, 2014 ; Silver et al., 2014 ; Sutherland and Geoffroy, 2020 ). Manipulating either its intrinsic or extrinsic environment is sufficient to modestly increase the ability of an injured axon to regenerate ( Curcio and Bradke, 2018 ; He and Jin, 2016 ; Schwab and Strittmatter, 2014 ; Tedeschi and Bradke, 2017 ; Tran et al., 2018 ). On the distal side of the injury, the most notable endogenous regulator of axon degeneration is Sterile Alpha and toll/interleukin-1 resistance (TIR) motif containing 1 (SARM1/dSarm), which is essential for injury-induced axon degeneration of mouse and fly axons ( Gerdts et al., 2013 ; Osterloh et al., 2012 ). SARM1/dSarm promotes axon degeneration cell-autonomously by depleting NAD + , interacting with the BTB/BACK domain protein Axundead, and interacting with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades, which in turn regulate calpain activation, SCG10/Stathmin-2 proteolysis, mitochondrial dysfunction, cytoskeletal disruption, and axon fragmentation ( Coleman and Hke, 2020 ; Essuman et al., 2017 ; Gerdts et al., 2015 ; Gerdts et al., 2016 ; Neukomm et al., 2017 ; Shin et al., 2012 ; Summers et al., 2020 ; Walker et al., 2017 ; Yang et al., 2015 ). The Caenorhabditis elegans SARM1/dSarm homolog, TIR-1, was first characterized as a determinant of neuronal asymmetry and the innate immune response, which it regulates in coordination with the NSY-1/ASK1 MAPK signaling pathway ( Chuang and Bargmann, 2005 ; Couillault et al., 2004 ; Liberati et al., 2004 ). In the absence of injury, TIR-1 has been found to regulate neurodegeneration in response to disease and age, upon multimerization, and in the absence of mitochondria ( Ding et al., 2022 ; Lezi et al., 2018 ; Loring et al., 2021 ; Vripe et al., 2015 ); however, whether TIR-1 regulates injury-induced axon degeneration is not known. Here we report that in addition to promoting injury-induced axon degeneration, TIR-1/SARM1 functions cell-autonomously to inhibit axon regeneration. Specifically, we find that loss of TIR-1 increases axon regeneration and that the ability to inhibit axon regeneration cell-intrinsically is conserved in human SARM1. In response to injury, TIR-1 functions with the NSY-1/ASK1 MAPK signaling cascade and the terminal transcription factor DAF-19/RFX to inhibit regeneration of the proximal axon fragment. In parallel, TIR-1 functions independently from NSY-1/ASK1 signaling and with the DLK-1/DLK MAPK pathway to promote degeneration of the distal axon fragment. Together, our results indicate that TIR-1 inhibits axon regeneration cell-autonomously, and that it does so by regulating a downstream pathway that is separable from its role in degeneration. Consequently, our results reveal a mechanism to shift the injury response toward repair. Results TIR-1/SARM1 inhibits axon regeneration In a candidate screen for genes that function on both sides of an injured axon, we asked whether tir-1 , the highly conserved C. elegans homolog of Sarm1/dSarm ( Mink et al., 2001 ), regulates the injury response ( Figure 1A ). To do so, we severed GABA motor neurons in tir-1 loss-of-function and wild-type animals with a pulsed laser and compared their morphology 24 hr later. We tested two putative null alleles of tir-1 ; the qd4 allele is a 1078 base pair deletion spanning exons 810 and the tm3036 allele is a smaller 269 base pair deletion in exon 8 that results in an early stop codon ( Pujol et al., 2008 ; Shivers et al., 2009 ). Both the qd4 and tm3036 deletions disrupt the C-terminal toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain, which is essential for TIR-1 function ( Chuang and Bargmann, 2005 ; Figure 1A ). Strikingly, we found that when GABA motor axons of tir-1 loss-of-function and wild-type animals were severed at the midline, significantly more axons regenerated in the absence of tir-1 ( Figure 1BD ). These data reveal that TIR-1 inhibits motor axon regeneration. Figure 1. TIR-1 inhibits axon regeneration. ( A ) Human SARM1, fly dSarm, and worm TIR-1 contain an N-terminal auto-inhibitory domain, two sterile alpha motif (SAM) domains and a toll-interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain. Null alleles qd4 and tm3036 disrupt the essential TIR domain. ( B ) C. elegans GABA motor neurons are axotomized to study the injury response in vivo and with single-axon resolution. ( C ) Representative GABA motor neurons before and 24 hr after single laser injury at the lateral midline of late larval stage (L4) animals (dashed line). Asterisks indicate distal fragments, arrowheads indicate retraction bulbs, and arrows indicate growth cones. Scale bar: 10 m. ( D ) More axons regenerate in tir-1 mutants compared to wild-type animals, as quantified by the percentage of axons that form a growth cone 24 hr after laser surgery. N = 152, 99, 60. ( E ) Regeneration phenotypes were categorized according to whether regenerating axons reached landmarks M  , M, M + , F, or failed to form a growth cone, N. ( F ) More tir-1 (-) axons initiate regeneration and reach the dorsal cord compared to wild-type axons, as indicated by a significant reduction in the number of axons that failed to form a growth cone (N) and a significant increase in the number of fully regenerated axons (Full). N = 158, 154. Significance relative to wild type is indicated by *p0.05, ***p0.001, Fishers exact test. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. Figure 1figure supplement 1. TOL-1 does not regulate axon regeneration. Axon regeneration is not significantly different in tol-1(nr2033 ) mutants compared to wild-type controls 24 hr after laser surgery. N = 6 5, 47. Fishers exact test. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. C. elegans have one other TIR domain-containing protein, which is TOL-1 ( Liberati et al., 2004 ). To determine whether regulation of axon regeneration is a general function of TIR domain-containing proteins, we compared regeneration in the presence and absence of tol-1 . We found no significant difference between the number of axons that regenerated in tol-1(nr2033 ) null mutants and wild-type animals ( Figure 1figure supplement 1 ). Therefore, TIR-1 is a TIR-domain-containing protein with a specific role in axon regeneration. Successful regeneration of C. elegans motor axons includes growth cone formation, axon extension, and responsiveness to cues that guide the axon to the dorsal nerve cord. To determine which stage of the regenerative process is inhibited by TIR-1, we grouped individual injured axons into categories depending on whether they initiated a growth cone and how far they regenerated toward the dorsal nerve cord ( Figure 1E and F ). We found a dramatic decrease in the number of axons that did not initiate regeneration (N) and an increase in the number of axons that regenerated the full distance to the dorsal nerve cord (Full) in tir-1 mutants compared to wild-type animals ( Figure 1F ). Of note, C. elegans are capable of repairing injured mechanosensory axons both by regenerating and fusing severed proximal and distal axon fragments ( Ghosh-Roy et al., 2010 ; Neumann et al., 2011 ). However, we did not observe fusion of severed motor axon fragments in either wild-type or tir-1 mutant animals. Together, these results indicate TIR-1 inhibits the initiation of axon regeneration and the successful extension of regenerating axons to their targets. TIR-1 functions cell-autonomously in GABA motor neurons to regulate axon regeneration We next asked how TIR-1 regulates axon regeneration and how it achieves specificity of function. TIR-1 functions in multiple cell types, including the nervous system, intestine, and epidermis, where it regulates neuronal development and the innate immune response ( Chuang and Bargmann, 2005 ; Couillault et al., 2004 ; Liberati et al., 2004 ; Pujol et al., 2008 ). To determine where TIR-1 functions to regulate axon regeneration, we first CRISPR tagged the endogenous tir-1 locus with mCherry and analyzed its expression pattern. With this single-copy integration of mCherry, we observed faint TIR-1 expression in the nervous system, particularly in the nerve ring, select cells in the head and tail, and in the dorsal cord and ventral cord, as well as in the intestine ( Figure 2A ). While tagging the endogenous locus is perhaps the most accurate in vivo representation of a genes expression pattern, cells that express the gene at low levels may not be detected. Therefore, we also constructed a transgenic strain expressing multiple copies of tir-1b::mCherry under the endogenous tir-1 promoter. The tir-1b isoform encodes the SAM and TIR domains but not the autoinhibitory N-terminus of TIR-1, and is predicted to be an activated form of TIR-1 ( Chuang and Bargmann, 2005 ). With this strain, we observed a similar pattern of TIR-1 expression in the intestine and nervous system. However, the increased copy number revealed TIR-1b::mCherry expression in the cell bodies and axons of GABA motor neurons ( Figure 2B ). The finding that TIR-1 is expressed in GABA motor neurons, albeit at relatively low levels, raises the possibility that TIR-1 could function cell-intrinsically to regulate axon regeneration. Figure 2. TIR-1 functions cell-autonomously to inhibit regeneration. ( A ) Endogenous TIR-1 is expressed faintly in the nervous system, particularly in neurons along the dorsal and ventral (enlarged box) nerve cords. Note the intestinal expression significantly overlaps with autofluorescent gut granules and therefore is not an accurate representation of endogenous tir-1 expression in the intestine. Scale bar:25 m. ( B ) Representative micrographs of transgenic animals expressing tir-1b::mCherry under its endogenous promoter indicates TIR-1b::mCherry is expressed in GABA neurons. Enlarged boxes show TIR-1b::mCherry expression in the cell bodies of GABA neurons. Scale bars: upper images, 25 m; insets, 10 m. ( C,D ) When expressed specifically in GABA neurons, mScarlet::tir-1b is expressed in a punctate pattern in the cell bodies and axons of GABA neurons before, immediately after and 7 hr after injury. Scale bars: 5 m. ( E ) GABA-specific expression of tir-1b rescues axon regeneration in tir-1(qd4 ) animals but not wild-type animals. N = 197, 148, 62, 50, 69. ( F ) GABA-specific expression of human SARM1 SAM-TIR lacking the N-terminal autoinhibitory domain rescues axon regeneration in single cut tir-1(qd4 ) mutants and not in wild-type animals. N = 91, 60, 53, 66, 50. Significance relative to wild type or tir-1(qd4 ) is indicated by *p0.05, **p0.01, ***p0.001, Fishers exact test. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. We investigated where TIR-1 functions to regulate regeneration by asking whether tissue-specific expression of tir-1b cDNA is sufficient to inhibit axon regeneration of injured GABA motor neurons. We expressed a GABA-specific unc-47p::mScarlet::tir-1b construct in tir-1(qd4 ) animals and observed punctate mScarlet::TIR-1b in the cell bodies and axons of GABA neurons, both before and after injury ( Figure 2C and D ). Axon regeneration was fully suppressed in animals that expressed tir-1b specifically in their GABA neurons compared to tir-1(qd4 ) animals ( Figure 2E ). Therefore, cell-intrinsic tir-1 function inhibits axon regeneration. The significance of the finding that tir-1 regulates regeneration is influenced by whether its function is conserved in homologous Sarm genes. TIR-1 and human SARM1 proteins are highly conserved, sharing 60% homology over 85% of the SARM1 sequence ( Altschul et al., 1997 ; Mink et al., 2001 ). As a result, both TIR-1 and human SARM1 contain multiple HEAT/Armadillo repeats in the autoinhibitory N-terminus followed by two sterile alpha motifs (SAM) and one toll-like interleukin repeat (TIR) domain ( Figure 1A ). We investigated whether intrinsic inhibition of axon regeneration is a conserved function of TIR-1 by asking whether motor neuron-specific expression of human SARM1 is also capable of inhibiting axon regeneration. As we observed with tir-1 , expressing an active form of human Sarm1 containing its SAM and TIR domains (hSarm1 SAMTIR ) in GABA motor neurons was sufficient to rescue the regeneration phenotype of tir-1(qd4 ) mutants ( Figure 2F ). Together, these results demonstrate that the ability to inhibit axon regeneration cell-autonomously is conserved in the human SARM1 SAMTIR protein. A novel model of injury-induced motor axon degeneration in C. elegans The finding that TIR-1 and human SARM1 can function intrinsically to inhibit axon regeneration is unexpected since Sarm1 and dSarm promote the opposite response to injury, axon degeneration, in mice and flies ( Gerdts et al., 2013 ; Osterloh et al., 2012 ). Whether TIR-1 also promotes injury-induced motor axon degeneration in C. elegans is not known. To answer that question, we needed to examine the consequences of mutating tir-1 in an injury paradigm that induces significant axon degeneration. Although the above axotomy assay, in which an axon is severed once, is extremely useful for investigating the genetic and cellular mechanisms that regulate axon regeneration ( Byrne and Hammarlund, 2017 ), it is not as robust a model of injury-induced axon degeneration. The obstacle is that while proximal segments, which remain attached to the cell body, regenerate in the 24 hr following injury ( Yanik et al., 2004 ), the distal segments, which are no longer attached to the cell body, remain largely intact ( Nichols et al., 2016 ). This prompted us to develop an assay with which robust injury-induced motor axon degeneration and axon regeneration can be investigated simultaneously in vivo. Here, rather than severing axons once, we severed individual axons in two places, approximately 25 m apart, which creates a middle fragment that degenerates ( Figure 3A ). The degeneration has similar morphological and temporal features as Wallerian degeneration, where after a brief latent period, the middle axon segment beads, fragments, and is eventually cleared ( Figure 3B ). We tested how reliably double injury induces degeneration of the middle fragment by quantifying the percentage of severed axons whose middle fragment either degenerated (complete clearance), partially degenerated (>65% of middle fragment degenerated) or largely remained intact (>80% of middle fragment remained). In wild-type axons, 90.2% of middle fragments degenerated 24 hr after double axotomy ( Figure 3C ). We did not observe a significant difference in the number of middle fragments when visualized with either cytosolic or myristoylated and membrane-bound GFP 1.5 hr and 24 hr after injury ( Figure 3D ), indicating that the observed degeneration is not caused by a release of cytosolic GFP from the severed fragments. Notably, significantly less axons degenerated 1.5 hr after injury compared to 24 hr after injury, suggesting the earlier time point represents a period of active degeneration ( Figure 3E ). Finally, we found that injured motor axons are less likely to degenerate in aged animals, indicating an active destruction process is either lost or suppressed with increased age ( Figure 3F ). Together, these data indicate that the observed degeneration is an active process, not caused by a leaky cytosolic reporter and that the double cut assay reliably induces axon degeneration that can be investigated in vivo and with single-neuron precision. Figure 3. TIR-1 promotes axon degeneration in injured GABA motor neurons. ( A ) Single and double injury models. After being severed once, GABA axons do not degenerate. Severing an axon twice creates a middle fragment that degenerates. ( B ) Micrographs of intact and degenerated middle fragments 24 hr post axotomy.

( H ) Expression of tir-1b specifically in GABA motor neurons restores regeneration to tir-1(qd4 ) animals. N = 211, 68, 34, 37. Significance relative to control is indicated by *p0.05, **p0.01, ***p0.001, Fishers exact test. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. Figure 3figure supplement 1. CED-1 does not regulate middle fragment degeneration. tir-1 functions independently from ced-1 to regulate degeneration of the middle fragment after injury. N = 125, 37, 40, 58. Significance relative to wild type is indicated by **p0.01, Fishers exact test. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. tir-1 is a functional ortholog of Sarm1 that promotes injury-induced axon degeneration Sarm1/dSarm is a key regulator of injury-induced degeneration in multiple species, including mammals, flies, and zebrafish ( Gerdts et al., 2013 ; Osterloh et al., 2012 ; Tian et al., 2020 ). To determine whether tir-1 is a functional ortholog of Sarm1/dSarm with a conserved role in injury-induced axon degeneration, we assayed its ability to regulate degeneration using the double-cut assay. We found that in tir-1 mutant animals, only 68% of middle fragments degenerated compared to 86% of middle fragments in wild-type animals ( Figure 3G ). Therefore, like Sarm1/dSarm , tir-1 positively regulates injury-induced axon degeneration. Expression of tir-1b specifically in GABA motor neurons restored middle fragment degeneration in tir-1(qd4 ) animals, indicating tir-1 functions cell-autonomously to regulate injury-induced axon degeneration ( Figure 3H ). Since loss of tir-1 incompletely suppressed axon degeneration, we investigated whether ced-1, a homolog of Draper and Megf10 , also contributes to the degeneration phenotype. CED-1 functions in the hypodermis and muscle cells of C. elegans to remove axonal debris after injury in mechanosensory neurons ( Chiu et al., 2018 ; Nichols et al., 2016 ). We found that injured motor axons in ced-1 loss-of-function animals degenerated as frequently as wild-type axons after double axotomy ( Figure 3figure supplement 1 ). Moreover, animals with loss-of-function mutations in both ced-1 and tir-1 phenocopied the amount of degeneration observed in tir-1 animals. These results demonstrate that middle fragment degeneration after double injury does not depend on ced-1 and that tir-1 functions independently from ced-1 to regulate injury-induced degeneration. Together with our finding that injury-induced degeneration is not completely dependent on tir-1 ( Figure 3F ), these data indicate C. elegans motor axons have evolved additional as yet unidentified regulators of injury-induced motor axon degeneration. We hypothesized that perhaps distal fragments do not degenerate after single axotomy because TIR-1 is not sufficiently activated by this type of injury. TIR-1 and SARM1 functions are autoinhibited by intramolecular and intermolecular interactions with their N-terminal domains ( Chuang and Bargmann, 2005 ; Figley et al., 2021 ; Gerdts et al., 2013 ; Horsefield et al., 2019 ; Jiang et al., 2020 ; Shen et al., 2021 ; Sporny et al., 2020 ; Summers et al., 2016 ). We asked whether low-level expression of an endogenous isoform lacking the autoinhibitory domain was sufficient to induce degeneration of GFP-labeled distal fragments, even after a single injury ( Figure 4 ). Strikingly, we found that low levels of GABA-specific TIR-1b expression caused the majority of distal stumps to degenerate after a single axotomy ( Figure 4AE ). Notably, degeneration was not observed in the proximal stumps, indicating that despite the lack of its autoinhibitory domain, TIR-1 specifically regulates degeneration distal to the site of injury. Therefore, in wild-type C. elegans , axons that have been injured once are likely incapable of degenerating, at least in part, because the injury response was of insufficient magnitude or identity to activate TIR-1. In contrast, a double axotomy may induce an enhanced injury response in the middle fragment, which is of sufficient magnitude or identity to activate TIR-1 or overcome its suppression. Figure 4. TIR-1 expression causes spontaneous axon degeneration in GABA motor neurons. ( AC ) Expression of mScarlet::tir-1b in GFP-labeled GABA motor neurons is sufficient to induce degeneration of the distal stump after a single axotomy. Micrographs and representative drawings demonstrate mScarlet::TIR-1b is localized in the cytoplasm in GABA cell bodies and along their axons in the ventral nerve cord, commissures, and dorsal nerve cord. Three timepoints are represented: ( A ) before injury, ( B ) immediately after injury, and ( C ) 7 hr after injury. At 7 hr, the distal stump has degenerated while the proximal stump remains intact.

For continuous data, significance relative to wild type is indicated by ***p0.001, Students t -test. Error bars represent SEM. Figure 4figure supplement 1. TIR-1 expression induces degeneration. Representative micrographs indicating axons that express the unc-47p::tir-1::mCherry transgene degenerate, whereas neighboring axons that do not express the transgene remain intact. Transgenic axons labeled with yellow arrow and non-transgenic axons labeled with white arrow. Cytosolic GFP is expressed from an integrated unc-47p::GFP construct, and therefore is expressed throughout the GABA nervous system. Scale bar: 10 m. To further investigate the extent to which TIR-1 is able to promote axon degeneration, we asked whether overexpressing TIR-1 is sufficient to induce motor axon degeneration in the absence of injury. When we expressed tir-1b at high concentrations, we found that GFP-labeled motor axons were beaded, severely fragmented, and degenerated even in the absence of injury ( Figure 4FH ). As a result, there was a significant decrease in the amount of GFP along the axon commissures and dorsal nerve cord of tir-1b overexpressing animals compared to the amount of GFP in wild-type controls ( Figure 4I and J ). The most obvious phenotype was the virtual absence of axon commissures that extended fully from the ventral to the dorsal nerve cord in tir-1 transgenic animals compared to wild-type animals ( Figure 4K ). Despite the absence of axons, the number of GABA neuron cell bodies was consistent between transgenic and non-transgenic animals, indicating tir-1 overexpression selectively induces axon degeneration and not cell death ( Figure 4G ). Importantly, the tir-1 transgene was expressed as an extrachromosomal array, resulting in mosaic GABA motor neuron expression. This mosaicism allowed us to find that the few non-transgenic GABA motor axons had a wild-type morphology, indicating the observed degeneration was caused by cell-autonomous overexpression of the tir-1b transgene and was not merely a secondary consequence of physically manipulating and imaging the animals ( Figure 4figure supplement 1 ). Therefore, elevated tir-1b expression within GABA neurons is sufficient to induce severe and chronic axon degeneration, even in the absence of injury. Together with the finding that loss of tir-1 function suppresses injury-induced axon degeneration, these data demonstrate that tir-1 positively regulates axon degeneration when it is constitutively activated or sufficiently activated by injury. TIR-1 regulates axon regeneration independently of its NADase activity and with the NSY-1PMK-1 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascade How does one gene regulate both seemingly opposite processes of repair and destruction in what was once the same cell? We proceeded to investigate how TIR-1 regulates both regeneration and degeneration using the double injury model. The ability to observe both axon regeneration and degeneration using the same injury model is essential for comparing how TIR-1 regulates the two seemingly opposite processes (1) within the same injured wild-type axon and (2) in the context of the same injury response. Indeed, the importance of comparing aspects of the injury response within the same injury model is manifest in the finding that axons regenerate significantly less frequently after a double injury compared to a single injury (60.53% of axons regenerate in the 24 hr following a single injury, and 37.38% of axons regenerate in the 24 hr following a double injury). For these reasons, unless otherwise indicated, the experiments below were performed using double axotomy. SARM1 and dSarm execute several cellular functions in injured axons, including cleavage of NAD + , regulation of MAPK signaling and the Axundead protein, as well as regulation of calcium signaling, gene transcription, and autophagy ( Coleman and Hke, 2020 ; Essuman et al., 2017 ; Neukomm et al., 2017 ; Walker et al., 2017 ; Yang et al., 2015 ). Early investigations of TIR-1 function revealed that it also signals through variations of a canonical downstream MAPK pathway in the innate immune response and in neuronal development ( Chuang and Bargmann, 2005 ; Couillault et al., 2004 ; Liberati et al., 2004 ; Pujol et al., 2008 ; Sagasti et al., 2001 ). The molecular mechanisms that mediate TIR-1, SARM1, and dSarm functions informed a candidate approach to dissect the genetic pathways in which TIR-1 regulates both axon regeneration and degeneration of injured axons. The NAD + hydrolase activity of SARM1 is conserved in the C. elegans TIR domain, in a TIR-1 isoform lacking the N-terminal inhibitory domain, and in the full-length TIR-1 protein ( Gerdts et al., 2016 ; Horsefield et al., 2019 ; Loring et al., 2021 ; Loring et al., 2020 ; Peterson et al., 2022 ; Summers et al., 2016 ). In SARM1, TIR domain function requires an active site containing the key catalytic residue E642, a structure specific to catalytically active TIR domains called a SARM-specific (SS) loop (residues 622635), a BB loop (residues 594605) thought to be important for intradomain interactions, and multiple residues important for interaction with the autoinhibitory domain and protein multimerization ( Essuman et al., 2017 ; Horsefield et al., 2019 ; Loring et al., 2021 ; Loring et al., 2020 ; Summers et al., 2016 ). To directly address whether TIR-1 regulates regeneration by hydrolyzing NAD + , we CRISPR edited the endogenous tir-1 gene to create mutations in the key catalytic residue ( tir-1(E788A )) and in the SS loop ( tir-1(D773A )), which correspond with SARM1 E642A and SARM1 D627A mutants, respectively ( Essuman et al., 2017 ; Loring et al., 2021 ; Summers et al., 2016 ). The conserved E788/E642/E1170 catalytic residue is required for the NADase activity of the TIR-1, SARM1, and dSarm TIR domains ( Brace et al., 2022 ; Essuman et al., 2017 ; Herrmann et al., 2022 ; Horsefield et al., 2019 ; Hsu et al., 2021 ; Loring et al., 2021 ; Peterson et al., 2022 ; Summers et al., 2016 ). The D773/D627 aspartate is also conserved in the SS loops of C. elegans and human TIR domains. It is required for NAD + catalysis by SARM1 and its ability to induce degeneration of injured DRGs but not for its ability to multimerize ( Loring et al., 2021 ; Summers et al., 2016 ). We found that both tir-1(E788A ) and tir-1(D773A ) mutant animals displayed wild-type levels of axon regeneration, indicating that TIR-1 E788A and TIR-1 D773A are functionally expressed and that neither residue are required for TIR-1 to inhibit axon regeneration ( Figure 5A ). Therefore, TIR-1 regulates regeneration independently of its NADase activity. Figure 5. TIR-1 functions independently of its NADase activity and with the NSY-1 signaling pathway to inhibit axon regeneration. ( A ) Conserved residues E788A/E642A, which is required for the NADase function of TIR-1 and SARM1, and D773A/D627 are not required to inhibit axon regeneration.

( A ) Axon regeneration is not significantly different between atf-7(gk715 ) mutants and wild type controls 24 hr after laser surgery. N = 90, 68, 35. Significance relative to wild type or tir-1(qd4 ) is indicated by **p0.01, ***p0.001, Fishers exact test. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. We began our search for NADase-independent mechanisms of TIR-1 function by investigating whether TIR-1 inhibits regeneration with established regulators of the injury response. Perhaps the most deterministic regulator of axon regeneration in C. elegans motor neurons is the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase DLK-1 (Dual leucine zipper kinase-1). DLK-1 function is absolutely required for the regeneration of otherwise wild-type GABA motor axons ( Hammarlund et al., 2009 ; Yan et al., 2009 ). We found that loss of tir-1 function did not suppress the complete absence of regeneration in either the dlk-1 loss-of-function mutant or the downstream pmk-3/ p38 MAPK loss-of-function mutant, indicating tir-1 either functions upstream of dlk-1 signaling or in a separate signaling pathway ( Figure 5B ). Physical interpretations of genetic interactions with genes that are essential for a given function can be difficult if that function requires the activity of multiple distinctly regulated processes. Therefore, since DLK-1 function is absolutely required for axon regeneration, these interactions do not distinguish between the possibilities that TIR-1 signaling regulates the activity of DLK-1 or that DLK-1 regulates an essential component of axon regeneration independently of TIR-1 signaling. However, the genetic interactions do indicate that TIR-1 does not function downstream of, or redundantly with, DLK-1 to regulate axon regeneration. We next asked whether previously identified TIR-1 interactors mediate its role in axon regeneration. Initial studies of TIR-1 identified a shared MAPK signaling cassette that interacts with TIR-1 to regulate neuronal development and innate immunity ( Chuang and Bargmann, 2005 ; Couillault et al., 2004 ; Liberati et al., 2004 ; Pujol et al., 2008 ; Sagasti et al., 2001 ). During neuronal development, TIR-1 interacts with the calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) ortholog UNC-43 and the MAP kinase kinase kinase NSY-1/ASK1 signaling pathway to specify the asymmetric neuronal identity of AWC olfactory neurons. Specifically, in response to calcium, TIR-1 and UNC-43 form a postsynaptic protein complex that transiently interacts with NSY-1, which in turn regulates odorant receptor expression through its downstream MAP kinases ( Chuang and Bargmann, 2005 ; Sagasti et al., 2001 ). In contrast, the TIR-1/NSY-1 signaling cassette functions independently of UNC-43 to regulate the innate immune response ( Couillault et al., 2004 ; Liberati et al., 2004 ; Pujol et al., 2008 ). We first asked whether TIR-1 regulates axon regeneration by interacting with the NSY-1 signal transduction pathway and found that loss of nsy-1 or its downstream MAP kinase pmk-1/p38 enhanced axon regeneration after double injury ( Figure 5C and F ). These regeneration phenotypes were not significantly enhanced by deletion of tir-1 . Because tir-1 , nsy-1 , and pmk-1 null mutants all inhibit axon regeneration to the same extent, and because the amount of regeneration in any pairwise combination of mutants is not additive or multiplicative compared to the single mutants, our data indicate that the three genes function in the same pathway to regulate axon regeneration after double injury ( Figure 5F ). Continuing our investigation of candidate interactors, we considered unc-43 because it was previously found to inhibit regeneration of sensory axons ( Chung et al., 2016 ). We found that unc-43(e408 ) phenocopied the increased axon regeneration of tir-1(qd4 ) mutants and addition of the unc-43(e408 ) mutation to tir-1(qd4 ) mutants did not further enhance regeneration ( Figure 5D ). Therefore, tir-1 and unc-43 function together in a shared genetic pathway to inhibit axon regeneration after double injury. Since the nsy-1 and pmk-1 null phenotypes fully recapitulate the tir-1(qd4 ) phenotype and because they have the opposite phenotype to dlk-1 mutants, the nsy-1 and dlk-1 MAP kinase pathways do not function redundantly to inhibit axon regeneration downstream of tir-1 . Together, these results indicate that tir-1 and the nsy-1pmk-1 MAPK pathway function together to inhibit axon regeneration, which is dependent on dlk-1 . After a single injury, the regeneration frequency and genetic interactions between tir-1 , nsy-1 , and pmk-1 null mutants were similar to those after a double injury and wild-type regeneration was not affected by the lack of NADase activity in tir-1(E788A ) animals ( Figure 5figure supplement 1 ). Interestingly, although wild-type axons regenerate less frequently after a double injury compared to a single injury, the magnitude of regeneration in TIR-1, NSY-1, and PMK-1 mutants is similar in axons that have been injured once ( Figure 5figure supplement 1A and B ) or twice ( Figure 5C ). Therefore, the TIR-1NSY-1PMK-1 pathway not only inhibits regeneration after both types of injury, it may be epistatic to what differentiates the regeneration frequency between the two types of injury. TIR-1 inhibits axon regeneration by regulating the RFX-type transcription factor DAF-19 CaMKII has previously been found to regulate axon regeneration and developmental axon outgrowth, in part by regulating transcription of effector genes ( Chung et al., 2016 ; Ghiretti et al., 2014 ; Xi et al., 2019 ). However, the signaling pathways and set of transcription factors that mediate the effects of CaMKII activation on target gene expression during regeneration are not known. Given the genetic interactions between tir-1 , unc-43 , nsy-1 , and pmk-1 , we hypothesized that UNC-43 might regulate axon regeneration via TIR-1 and NSY-1-dependent transcription. We examined this possibility by testing the regenerative ability of animals with predicted null mutations in the cAMP-dependent transcription factor atf-7/ATF2/CREB5 and in the Regulatory Factor X transcription factor daf-19/RFX , both of which are regulated by nsy-1 signaling ( Shivers et al., 2009 ; Vripe et al., 2015 ; Xie et al., 2013 ). Loss of atf-7 function did not affect GABA axon regeneration, consistent with previous studies of PLM mechanosensory axon regeneration ( Figure 5figure supplement 2 ; Ghosh-Roy et al., 2010 ). However, loss of daf-19 function increased regeneration to the same extent as loss of tir-1 and did not enhance the regeneration phenotype of the tir-1 null mutants ( Figure 5D ). Together, these data are consistent with a model in which an unc-43/tir-1/nsy-1/pmk-1/daf-19 signaling cascade ( Figure 5E ) inhibits axon regeneration by altering transcription of downstream regeneration-associated genes. TIR-1 regulates degeneration in coordination with DLK-1 MAPK signaling To determine how TIR-1 achieves specificity of function on either side of the injury, we also asked how it promotes axon degeneration. Since SARM1 and TIR-1 are established NAD + hydrolases ( Essuman et al., 2017 ; Horsefield et al., 2019 ; Loring et al., 2021 ; Loring et al., 2020 ; Peterson et al., 2022 ; Summers et al., 2016 ), we began by asking whether TIR-1 regulates regeneration by hydrolyzing NAD + in injured axons. To do so, we quantified degeneration in TIR-1 E788A animals (homologous to SARM1 E642A ), which renders the TIR domain of C. elegans TIR-1 catalytically dead ( Essuman et al., 2017 ; Loring et al., 2020 ; Peterson et al., 2022 ). Interestingly, the E788A/E642A mutation did not suppress injury-induced axon degeneration ( Figure 6A ), indicating TIR-1 can regulate axon degeneration independently of its NAD + hydrolase activity. This ability contrasts sharply with the requirement for NAD + hydrolysis in dSarm and SARM1-mediated degeneration ( Brace et al., 2022 ; Essuman et al., 2017 ; Gerdts et al., 2015 ; Herrmann et al., 2022 ; Hsu et al., 2021 ), indicating TIR-1 regulates a previously unexplored mechanism of axon degeneration. Figure 6. TIR-1 is capable of NADase-independent and -dependent axon degeneration. ( A ) Mutation of conserved residue E788A/E642A, which is required for the NADase function of TIR-1 and SARM1, does not affect axon degeneration after double axotomy. D773A/D627A modestly suppresses degeneration. N = 97, 106, 64. ( B ) Conserved residues E788A/E642A and D773A/D627A are required for chronic axon degeneration. Lines represent independently generated transgenic strains that were generated by injecting equal concentrations of the same tir-1b ::mCherry expression plasmid into separate tir-1(qd4 ) animals and isolating transgenic lines from each animal. N = 34, 32, 33, 23, 1211, 17. ( C ) Equivalent amounts of wild-type tir-1b , tir-1b(e788a ), and tir-b(d773A ) transgenes are expressed, as quantified by total mCherry fluorescence in the cell bodies of tir-1(qd4 ) animals, which were identified by expression of an integrated GABA-specific GFP marker, oxIs12 (N = 63, 70, 70). Significance relative to wild type was determined by one-way ANOVA and Dunnetts test and is indicated by ****p0.0001. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. We then asked whether other components of the TIR domain are required for its ability to regulate axon degeneration. Specifically, we investigated residue D773, which is homologous to D627 in the SS-loop of SARM1 that is required for injury-induced degeneration of DRG axons yet promotes the TIR domains NADase activity through unspecified mechanisms ( Loring et al., 2020 ; Summers et al., 2016 ). We found that axon degeneration in tir-1(D773A ) mutants was slightly but significantly disrupted compared to wild-type animals and was similar to that seen in tir-1(qd4 ) animals ( Figure 6A ). These data indicate the SS loop is important for TIR-1s ability to promote degeneration of injured axons. Collectively, the findings that mutation of the key catalytic glutamate E788A abolishes NADase activity ( Peterson et al., 2022 ) but not degeneration, along with previous data showing the SS-loop residue D627 promotes the NADase activity of SARM1 through relatively unknown mechanisms ( Loring et al., 2020 ; Summers et al., 2016 ), indicate that the D773A/D627A mutation suppresses degeneration by disrupting an as yet unidentified function of TIR-1. Notably, D773A/D627A is not a null mutation since it did not disrupt the ability of TIR-1 to inhibit regeneration ( Figure 5A ). It follows that TIR-1 regulates axon regeneration and degeneration by different mechanisms, potentially by directly interacting with components of the UNC-43-NSY-1-PMK-1 pathway on the proximal side of the injury and another signal transduction pathway on the distal side of the injury. The surprising finding that TIR-1 is capable of NADase-independent degeneration in response to injury prompted us to ask whether TIR-1 is capable of inducing NADase-dependent axon degeneration in other contexts. We found that while expressing large amounts of wild-type tir-1b induced significant axon degeneration even in the absence of injury, expressing either tir-1b(E788A/E642A ) or tir-1b(D773A/D627A ) did not ( Figure 6B ). The absence of spontaneous degeneration in the presence of TIR-1b(D773A) and TIR-1b(E788A) is not likely attributed to differential expression of the mutant and wild-type transgenes, which was determined by quantifying expression of the fluorescent tag on each protein ( Figure 6C ). However, because a small but statistically insignificant number of damaged axons were observed, we cannot rule out the possibility that greater TIR-1b(D773A) or TIR-1b(E788A) expression might induce NADase-independent degeneration. Together with our previous results, we find that D773 is required for both injury-induced and spontaneous degeneration, while E788 is only required for spontaneous degeneration. These data indicate D773A disrupts multiple facets of TIR-1 function, and the NADase activity of TIR-1 is required to induce spontaneous degeneration when overexpressed in uninjured axons but is not required for degeneration of injured axon fragments. Therefore, the question remains: how does TIR-1 regulate NADase-independent degeneration of injured axons? We first investigated whether TIR-1 signals with the same nsy-1pmk-1 MAPK pathway that mediates its function on the proximal side of the injury by measuring the presence or absence of middle fragments 24 hr after double injury in the absence of the MAPK pmk-1 . Loss of pmk-1 did not have a degeneration phenotype on its own and double tir-1; pmk-1 mutant animals phenocopied the degeneration observed in tir-1 mutant animals ( Figure 7A ). This lack of genetic interaction indicates that tir-1 functions independently from pmk-1 to promote axon degeneration after injury. Figure 7. TIR-1 functions with the DLK-1 signaling pathway to regulate axon degeneration. ( A ) Loss of pmk-1/p38 does not affect degeneration with or without tir-1 function. N = 198, 68, 54, 71. ( B ) Loss of dlk-1 function suppresses the decreased degeneration of tir-1(qd4 ) animals and overexpression of dlk-1 in GABA motor neurons inhibits degeneration, indicating DLK-1 negatively regulates axon degeneration.

DLK MAPK-signaling functions with SARM1/dSarm to regulate axon degeneration in mice and flies ( Miller et al., 2009 ; Walker et al., 2017 ; Welsbie et al., 2013 ; Xiong and Collins, 2012 ; Xiong et al., 2010 ; Yang et al., 2015 ). In our assay, loss of either dlk-1 or its downstream p38 MAP kinase pmk-3 did not affect axon degeneration on their own; however, they did rescue axon degeneration in tir-1 mutants ( Figure 7B ). This result suggests the decreased axon degeneration phenotype of tir-1 mutants depends on dlk-1 pathway activity. However, due to the high amount of axon degeneration in wild-type animals, it is possible that an upper threshold in the assay prevents us from seeing enhanced degeneration above wild-type levels. Therefore, to further investigate whether dlk-1 inhibits axon degeneration, we asked whether overexpression of dlk-1 would protect axons. We found that, indeed, significantly less severed axon fragments degenerated in dlk-1(oe ) animals relative to wild-type animals ( Figure 7B and C , Figure 7figure supplement 1 ). Of note, DLK-1 function is not responsible for inhibiting degeneration after a single injury as neither loss or gain of dlk-1 function induced degeneration of singly injured distal axon fragments ( Figure 7figure supplement 2 ). Therefore, DLK-1s ability to inhibit degeneration is context specific. The suppression of degeneration in doubly injured dlk-1(oe ) axons was not dependent on tir-1 function ( Figure 7B ). However, loss of pmk-3/ p38 MAPK function rescued degeneration in both dlk-1(oe ) and tir-1(- ) animals, as well as in double dlk-1(oe); tir-1(- ) mutants ( Figure 7B ). The simplest interpretation of these genetic epistasis analyses is that PMK-3 inhibits degeneration downstream of its canonical MAPKKK DLK-1, and also functions downstream of TIR-1. These findings support a model in which TIR-1 promotes degeneration by antagonizing or opposing the inhibitory role of DLK-1-PMK-3 signaling. However, the exact nature of the complex relationship between TIR-1, DLK-1, and PMK-3 are exciting future avenues of investigation, as is the question of how degeneration is effected in the absence of TIR-1. Together, our data indicate that TIR-1 promotes axon degeneration by directly or indirectly antagonizing DLK-1-PMK-3 function on the distal side of the injury and inhibits regeneration with UNC-43NSY-1PMK-1DAF-19 signaling on the proximal side of the injury ( Figure 7D ). Discussion Understanding the mechanisms that determine whether axons regenerate and degenerate is critical to our ability to stimulate repair after neuronal injury ( Girouard et al., 2018 ). Here, we identify TIR-1/SARM1/dSarm, a central regulator of axon degeneration, as a previously uncharacterized intrinsic inhibitor of axon regeneration that can be targeted to increase repair of injured motor axons. Our data indicate that to achieve this specificity of function, tir-1 inhibits axon regeneration with the NSY-1PMK-1 MAPK pathway on the proximal side of the injury while it promotes degeneration by antagonizing the DLK-1PMK-3 MAPK pathway on the distal side of the injury. Together, our findings reveal divergent mechanisms by which TIR-1 regulates the injury response. TIR-1/SARM1 functions intrinsically to regulate both axon regeneration and axon degeneration We found that TIR-1 inhibits axon regeneration and does so independently of its role in degeneration by investigating the injury response in a new model of C. elegans motor axon injury. C. elegans has been a powerful model of axon regeneration owing to its genetic tractability, the ability to carry out experiments in vivo with single-axon resolution, and because the majority of its genes are conserved with mammals ( Byrne et al., 2011 ; Kim et al., 2018b ; Yanik et al., 2004 ). In addition, the C. elegans motor nervous system lacks myelin and glia, enabling investigation of mechanisms that regulate axon regeneration independently of these extrinsic cues. The finding that both tir-1 and human Sarm1 can function cell-autonomously to inhibit axon regeneration indicates intrinsic regulation of axon regeneration may be a conserved function of SARM proteins. C. elegans has not been a robust model of motor axon degeneration because in the standard injury model, in which motor axons are cut once, the distal segment remains largely intact in adult animals ( Nichols et al., 2016 ). Why the distal segment of severed C. elegans motor axons remain intact has been a long-standing point of curiosity ( Figure 7figure supplement 2 ). Here, we found that severing an axon twice creates a middle fragment that completely degenerates and a proximal segment that is capable of regenerating. It follows that since double axotomy does induce degeneration, the resulting injury response may be more representative of the injury responses of other invertebrates and mammals compared to single axotomy. Practically, the double injury assay combines the tractability of C. elegans with the ability to investigate motor axon regeneration and degeneration on either side of the injury. The resulting finding that tir-1 functions cell-autonomously to simultaneously inhibit regeneration of the proximal axon fragment while also promoting degeneration of the distal axon fragment raises a number of questions. One of which is whether the enhanced regeneration in tir-1 mutants is not simply a secondary consequence of reduced degeneration. Either reducing the function of intrinsic inhibitors or changing the amount of extrinsic cues in the environment, such as degeneration and inflammation, can promote axon regeneration ( Curcio and Bradke, 2018 ; He and Jin, 2016 ; Schwab and Strittmatter, 2014 ; Tedeschi and Bradke, 2017 ; Tran et al., 2018 ). Here, we found that axons lacking tir-1 regenerate more often than wild-type axons after a single injury even though a single injury does not cause degeneration in either wild-type or tir-1 mutants. Thus, the increased regeneration of tir-1 mutants is not a secondary consequence of a decrease in degeneration. Combined with our finding that tir-1 functions within GABA axons to regulate axon regeneration, our data suggest that tir-1 functions within the proximal fragments of injured axons to inhibit axon regeneration independently from its role in degeneration. TIR-1/SARM1 inhibits axon regeneration with the NSY-1/ASK1 MAPK signaling pathway Our finding that tir-1 regulates both axon regeneration and degeneration raises the question of how this single gene differentially regulates opposite functions in what was once the same axon. Our data indicate that TIR-1/SARM1 carries out these opposing functions by interacting with two divergent MAP kinase signaling pathways on either side of the injury. On the proximal side, TIR-1/SARM1 functions with UNC-43/CAMKII, the NSY-1/ASK1PMK-1/p38 MAPK signaling cascade, and the transcription factor DAF-19/RFX to inhibit axon regeneration. The involvement of DAF-19 suggests that TIR-1 activation may change the transcriptional profile of the proximal fragment into one that does not support repair. Unlike the TIR-1NSY-1PMK-1 pathway that regulates the innate immune response and serotonin biosynthesis, DAF-19 does not require the co-transcription factor ATF-7 to regulate axon regeneration ( Xie et al., 2013 ). Therefore, TIR-1 likely achieves specificity of function by regulating the activity or expression of particular transcription factors in a temporal and tissue-specific manner in response to injury. SARM1 has been found to regulate a c-Jun-mediated transcriptional program and an immune response in injured mammalian axons ( Wang et al., 2018 ). Whether it could also regulate cytoskeletal dynamics and regeneration in specific cellular contexts through RFX-mediated transcription is an interesting question. The additional finding that axon regeneration is not affected by mutation in the predicted NADase residue E788A/E642A suggests that the role of tir-1 in axon regeneration does not depend on its ability hydrolyze NAD + . TIR-1s ability to regulate regeneration in coordination with NSY-1 signaling and independently of its NADase activity contrasts with recent findings that dSarm regulates neuromuscular junction formation and glial phagocytosis using both its NADase activity and interaction with Ask1 signaling ( Brace et al., 2022 ; Herrmann et al., 2022 ). The NADase-independent function of TIR-1 also contrasts with the findings that dSarm, mSarm, and hSARM1 rely on their ability to hydrolyze NAD + to regulate axon degeneration ( Brace et al., 2022 ; Herrmann et al., 2022 ; Hsu et al., 2021 ). However, the TIR-1 mechanism parallels the mechanism by which dSarm regulates axon transport within uninjured bystander neurons, which occurs independently of its NADase activity and by interacting with the voltage-gated calcium channel Cacophony (Cac) and Ask1/NSY-1 MAPK signaling ( Hsu et al., 2021 ). These data indicate that dSarm and tir-1 can regulate multiple components of the injury response independently of NAD + hydrolysis. Whether UNC-43TIR-1NSY-1PMK-1DAF-19 signaling inhibits regeneration in C. elegans by suppressing axon transport and how the NSY-1/ASK1 pathway differentially regulates its downstream functions are interesting questions of future investigation. Our finding that TIR-1 regulates regeneration also raises the question of whether TIR-1s role in regeneration is dependent on NMNAT activity. NMNAT antagonizes SARM1 by maintaining NAD + in the allosteric pocket of SARM1, which inhibits its NAD + hydrolase activity ( Bratkowski et al., 2020 ; Figley et al., 2021 ; Horsefield et al., 2019 ; Jiang et al., 2020 ; Sasaki et al., 2016 ; Shi et al., 2022 ; Sporny et al., 2020 ). In NMAT mutants, NAD + is replaced by NMN in the allosteric pocket and the altered conformation of SARM1 activates its NADase activity ( Figley et al., 2021 ; Sasaki et al., 2016 ; Shi et al., 2022 ). Previous work demonstrates that NMNAT2 inhibits axon regeneration in C. elegans mechanosensory axons ( Kim et al., 2018a ). This could lead to the prediction that NMAT-2 might also inhibit regeneration by inhibiting the NAD + hydrolase activity of TIR-1. However, here we find that TIR-1 inhibits regeneration of motor axons independently of its function as an NAD + hydrolase, indicating that NMNAT-2 must not inhibit regeneration by suppressing the NADase activity of TIR-1. Nonetheless, it remains possible that an NMNAT-dependent change in conformation determines whether TIR-1 can interact with downstream effectors of regeneration such as NSY-1. In this model, NMAT-2 would indeed facilitate TIR-1s ability to inhibit regeneration. Alternatively, since many genes differentially regulate axon regeneration in a cell-type-dependent manner ( Kim et al., 2018a ), it is also possible that NMAT-2 and TIR-1 differentially regulate regeneration in the mechanosensory and motor axons. TIR-1/SARM1 regulates injury-induced axon degeneration in coordination with the DLK-1 MAPK signaling pathway On the distal side of the injury, our data suggest that TIR-1 regulates degeneration by interacting with an alternate MAPK pathway. Loss of pmk-1 function has no effect on axon degeneration, nor does it affect the degeneration phenotype of tir-1 loss-of-function mutants, indicating that TIR-1 regulates axon degeneration independently from the NSY-1PMK-1 MAPK pathway. Instead, TIR-1 promotes axon degeneration through interaction with DLK-1PMK-3 MAPK signaling. Specifically, our data suggest that in C. elegans, TIR-1 promotes injury-induced degeneration by inhibiting a protective function of DLK-1 and PMK-3. The protective function of DLK-1 and PMK-3 in axon degeneration appears to be conserved in specific contexts. For example, Wallenda (Wnd), the DLK-1 homolog in Drosophila melanogaster inhibits axon degeneration in motor axons that have undergone a conditioning lesion ( Xiong and Collins, 2012 ). However, Wallenda also promotes degeneration in singly severed olfactory receptor axons and mammalian DLK promotes degeneration of severed dorsal root ganglion axons ( Ghosh et al., 2011 ; Miller et al., 2009 ). While it is unlikely that the small amount of time between axotomies in the double injury model induces a conditioning lesion, the comparison demonstrates that the nature of MAPK activity can be differentially determined by specific types of injury and by cell type. In relation to SARM signaling, SARM1 and dSarm also regulate axon degeneration by interacting with the signaling pathways of DLK-1 homologs Wallenda and DLK ( Summers et al., 2020 ; Walker et al., 2017 ; Yang et al., 2015 ). Separate studies have found that MAPK signaling functions downstream of SARM1 to regulate degeneration of crushed retinal ganglion cells and upstream of SARM1 to regulate degeneration of cultured mammalian dorsal root ganglia neurons and Drosophila motoneurons ( Summers et al., 2018 ; Walker et al., 2017 ; Yang et al., 2015 ). Together with this multifaceted relationship between SARM1 and MAPK signaling, our data indicate the highly conserved TIR-1, dSarm, and SARM1 proteins regulate injury-induced degeneration through interactions with shared MAPK signaling components. However, the precise interactions between TIR-1/SARM1/dSarm and DLK-1/MAPK/Wnd signaling are complex and likely depend on cell type, form of injury, and species. Identifying the similarities and differences between the various interactions between SARM and MAPK signaling across species and types of injury will be important to understanding how these complex genes regulate the injury response. In addition to regulating the injury response, TIR-1 is required for degeneration in a C. elegans model of ALS, functions in the epidermis to promote age-dependent degeneration of PVD dendrites, induces spontaneous degeneration when forced to multimerize, and inhibits spontaneous axon degeneration of PVQ interneurons in mutant ric-7(- ) animals, which lack mitochondria ( Ding et al., 2022 ; Lezi et al., 2018 ; Loring et al., 2021 ; Rawson et al., 2014 ; Vripe et al., 2015 ). Questions raised specifically from a comparison of the opposite destructive and protective roles of TIR-1 in response to injury and absence of mitochondria include whether a specific injury signal determines that TIR-1 takes on a destructive role and whether TIR-1 can protect multiple types of neurons against the spontaneous degeneration that is induced by the absence of mitochondria. Looking downstream, we found the map kinase pmk-3 is epistatic to tir-1 and inhibits injury-induced axon degeneration. Interestingly, pmk-3 was also found to inhibit spontaneous degeneration in the absence of mitochondria, suggesting the difference between promotion and suppression of degeneration may ultimately be attributed to differential regulation of PMK-3 in these two contexts. To date, how SARM1 ultimately leads to axon degeneration after injury is not completely clear. Besides MAP kinase signaling, effectors of dSarm and SARM1 function include diminished levels of NAD + and the downstream Axundead protein ( Essuman et al., 2017 ; Neukomm et al., 2017 ). C. elegans does not have an identifiable Axundead homolog; however, the NADase activity of SARM1 and dSarm is conserved, albeit perhaps to a weaker extent, in the C. elegans TIR domain ( Horsefield et al., 2019 ; Loring et al., 2020 ; Neukomm et al., 2017 ; Peterson et al., 2022 ; Summers et al., 2016 ). Our finding that TIR-1 can promote injury-induced degeneration despite having a E788A/E642A mutation in its key catalytic residue, along with a recent finding that E788A renders the C. elegans TIR domain catalytically dead and is required for TIR-1-mediated pathogen avoidance, indicates that although TIR-1 does function as an NADase, it regulates injury-induced axon degeneration independently of its NADase activity. How the D773A/D627A mutation disrupts TIR function remains an open question ( Loring et al., 2020 ; Summers et al., 2016 ). It is possible that in addition to disrupting the enzymatic activity of TIR-1, D773A also disrupts one of the many complex intramolecular and intermolecular interactions of TIR-1, which suppresses degeneration by disrupting a yet unidentified mechanism of action. Knowing whether TIR-1 induces injury induced degeneration through direct interaction with DLK-1 will contribute significantly to our understanding of how TIR-1 promotes NADase-independent degeneration. While TIR-1 can promote NADase-independent degeneration, dSarm and SARM1 depend on NAD + hydrolysis to regulate injury-induced degeneration ( Brace et al., 2022 ; Herrmann et al., 2022 ; Hsu et al., 2021 ). Interestingly, while overexpressing wild-type tir-1b in motor neurons induced spontaneous degeneration, expressing the same amount of mutant tir-1b , containing the D773A or E788A mutation, did not induce significant degeneration. Therefore, while TIR-1 does not require its NADase activity to promote injury-induced degeneration, it can use its enzymatic activity to induce spontaneous axon degeneration. These data suggest that TIR-1 has evolved dual mechanisms to regulate degeneration in response to different insults that it encounters in the wild. The finding that TIR-1, a homolog of dSarm and SARM1, essential regulators of axon degeneration, also regulates the opposite response to injury, axon regeneration, is unexpected. In addition, TIR-1 was not thought to regulate injury-induced degeneration of C. elegans axons, likely because adult motor axons do not robustly degenerate using the single-injury assay and because degeneration of injured mechanosensory axons is regulated by apoptotic engulfment machinery in surrounding tissues, and not by TIR-1 ( Byrne et al., 2011 ; Nichols et al., 2016 ). The identified dual role of TIR-1 in the injury response raises a number of compelling questions, including: Is TIR-1 differentially activated on either side of the injury to determine whether a fragment repairs itself or self-destructs? Does TIR-1 regulate regeneration throughout the nervous system, or, like other intrinsic regulators of regeneration, does it function according to cell type and age ( Byrne et al., 2014 ; Duan et al., 2015 ; Geoffroy et al., 2016 )? Recent studies support the idea that SARM orthologs might function intrinsically to directly regulate axon regeneration. Systemic inhibition of tir-1/Sarm1 increases axon regeneration after injury in zebrafish. In addition, a mammalian study suggests functional recovery and axon regeneration after injury is improved in the absence of SARM1 function in neurons and in astrocytes, in part due to reduced inflammation and increased protection of injured axons ( Asgharsharghi et al., 2021 ; Liu et al., 2021 ). This data is supported by a preceding finding that SARM1 function within injured axons regulates an immune response that triggers inflammation ( Wang et al., 2018 ). Another recent study demonstrated that SARM1 knockout mice have more collateral axon branching and increased cytoskeletal dynamics in postnatal sensory neurons, indicating that SARM1 inhibits axon growth even in the absence of injury ( Ketschek et al., 2022 ). In light of these results, our finding that GABA-specific TIR-1 and hSARM1 expression inhibits axon regeneration even in animals that lack extrinsic inflammatory cells raises the intriguing question of whether SARM1 signaling can be manipulated to promote axon regeneration by directly driving cytoskeletal growth in injured mammalian axons. In conclusion, we present a model where TIR-1 functions cell-autonomously in GABA motor neurons to regulate axon regeneration. We show that to achieve specificity TIR-1 directs the opposite processes of axon regeneration and axon degeneration by interacting with divergent downstream MAPK signaling pathways on either side of the injury. Understanding how TIR-1 regulates a balance between axon regeneration and degeneration may provide novel ways to push the nervous system toward regeneration in response to injury. Materials and methods C. elegans strains and culture Unless otherwise noted, all C. elegans strains were maintained at 20C on NGM plates seeded with OP50 Escherichia coli . Strains listed below were kindly provided by the Alkema, Francis, Hammarlund, Pukkila-Worley, Hanna-Rose labs, and the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center, which is funded by the NIH Office of Research Infrastructure Programs (P40 OD010440). To visualize GABA motor neurons, strains were crossed into EG1285 ( oxIs12 [unc-47p::GFP, lin-15(+)] ). Mutants used in this study: tir-1(qd4), tir-1(tm3036), ufIs175(flp-13p::myristoylatedGFP), nsy-1(ag3), pmk-1(km25); unc-43(e408), daf-19(m86), dlk-1(ju476), pmk-3(ok169), pnc-1(ku212), tol-1(nr2033), ced-1(e1735), atf-7(gk715 ). Laser axotomy, imaging, and quantification Axotomy was performed as previously described ( Byrne et al., 2011 ), unless otherwise stated below. Larval stage 4 (L4) worms were mounted on 3% agarose pads and immobilized with microbeads (Polysciences) or 0.1 mM levamisole. Single injuries were made at the midline of the axon commissure and 13 axons were cut per worm. Double injuries were made with two targeted cuts, one roughly halfway between the ventral nerve cord and the midline of the worm and the second roughly halfway between the midline of the worm and the dorsal nerve cord, creating an approximately 25 m middle fragment. The two injuries are performed within seconds of each other in the same order (proximal-distal). One axon was cut per worm in the double injury experiments. Axon regeneration was quantified 24 hr after injury unless otherwise stated by placing animals immobilized with microbeads or 0.1 mM levamisole on a 3% agarose pad. Animals were imaged with a Nikon 100x 1.4 NA objective, Andor Zyla sCMOS camera and Leica EL6000 light source. Regeneration was scored as the percent of axons that regenerated fully to the dorsal cord (F), 75% of the distance to the dorsal cord (M + ), to the midline (M), to below the midline or had 3+ filopodia extending from the proximal segment (M  ). Axons that failed to regenerate or had two or fewer small filopodia protruding from the proximal segment were scored as N and NF, respectively. To control for day-to-day and instrument-to-instrument variability, experiments were carried out with same day controls on one axotomy rig. CRISPR CRISPR gene editing was conducted as previously described ( Dokshin et al., 2018 ). crRNA, tracrRNA, and Cas9 were obtained from IDT and injected with the rol-6 co-injection marker. CRISPR mutants were genotyped and outcrossed before analysis. TIR-1 expression We generated transgenic lines expressing TIR-1 under its endogenous promoter by expressing bamEx102[ tir-1p::tir-1b::mCherry::unc-54 3UTR+ceh-22::gfp] in ABC16 ( tir-1(qd4); oxIs12[unc-47p::GFP, lin-15(+)] ) animals using standard microinjection ( Mello et al., 1991 ). L4 stage animals were imaged on Perkin Elmer Precisely UltraVIEW VoX confocal imaging system. To determine the subcellular localization of TIR-1, we generated transgenic animals expressing unc-47p::mScarlet::tir-1b:: let-858 3UTR and co-injection marker ceh-22::gfp in EG1285 ( oxIs12[unc-47p::GFP, lin-15(+ )]) animals. To determine the tissue specificity of TIR-1 function, we generated transgenic animals expressing unc-47p::mScarlet::tir-1b::let-858 3UTR and co-injection marker pstr-1::gfp in ABC16 ( tir-1(qd4); oxIs12 [unc-47p::GFP ]) animals. To determine whether TIR-1 promotes chronic axon degeneration, we expressed unc-47p::tir-1b::mCherry::unc-54 3UTR and co-injection marker pstr-1::gfp in EG1285 ( oxIs12[unc-47p::GFP, lin-15(+ )]) animals. Transgenic lines were established using standard protocols ( Mello et al., 1991 ). L4 stage animals were imaged on Perkin Elmer Precisely UltraVIEW VoX confocal imaging system. hSARM1 expression To determine whether axon regeneration is a conserved function of SARM1, we built transgenic animals expressing mScarlet::SARM1 from the unc-47 GABA-specific promoter. The SARM1 plasmid was a kind gift from the Fitzgerald lab at UMass Medical School. The SAM-TIR domain of SARM1 was cloned into the unc-47p::mScarlet::tir-1b::let858 3UTR plasmid. The resulting unc-47p::mScarlet::SARM1::let858 3UTR plasmid was injected into ABC16 ( tir-1(qd4) III; oxIs12 X ) and oxIs12(unc-47p::GFP X ) animals. The plasmid was injected at a final concentration of 10 ng/ul to generate bamEx4070, bamEx4072, bamEx4073. Further we amplified a 1.286 kb band spanning the end of the mScarlet sequence into the beginning of the let-858 3 UTR using PCR to confirm expression within these animals (primers: GCCGACTTCAAGACCACCTACAAG and CAACGACGTTGGCGTCGATC ). Injury-induced degeneration Middle fragment degeneration after double injury was quantified 24 hr after injury unless otherwise indicated and grouped into three categories: degenerated (complete clearance), partially degenerated (>65% of the middle fragment degenerated), or largely remained intact (>80% of middle fragment remained) 24 hr after double injury. Chronic degeneration in the absence of injury was assessed by immobilizing L4 stage worms with 0.1 mM levamisole on a 3% agarose pad. Images were taken on a Perkin Elmer Precisely UltraVIEW VoX spinning disc confocal imaging system using a 40x objective. Images were compressed and exported as TIFF files for processing in FIJI. The axon or dorsal nerve cord segment to be analyzed was traced using a segmented line ROI of fixed size and mean intensity was quantified. NADase point mutations To determine whether the NADase function of TIR-1 is required to induce chronic degeneration, we built transgenic animals expressing either unc-47p::tir-1b(E788A)::mCherry::unc-54 3UTR or unc-47p::tir-1b(D773A)::mCherry::unc-54 3UTR plasmids. Point mutations were generated using QuikChange site directed mutagenesis on the unc-47p::tir-1b::mCherry::unc-54 3UTR plasmid. Primers used to create the E788A point mutation were GCACAAAGCGCTGAAATGTGCATTTG and CATTTCAGCGCTTTGTGCACCCAATCC . Primers used to generate the D773A point mutation were CAGTTTGGCTAGACTTTTAAATGATGATAACTG and GTCTAGCCAAACTGTTTGGTGTGAG . The resulting plasmids were injected into ABC16 ( tir-1(qd4) III; oxIs12 X ) animals at 50 ng/ul with ceh-22::GFP as a co-injection marker to generate bamEx4003[ unc-47p::tir-1b(E788A)::mCherry::unc-54 3UTR+ceh-22::GFP ], bamEx4052[ unc-47p::tir-1b(E788A)::mCherry::unc-54 3UTR+ceh-22::GFP ], bamEx4049[ unc-47p::tir-1b(D773A)::mCherry::unc-54 3UTR+ceh-22:GFP ], bamEx4050[ unc-47p::tir-1b(D773A)::mCherry::unc-54 3UTR+ceh-22::GFP ] animals. The number of intact, damaged, and missing GABAergic axons was quantified by mounting L4 stage animals on 3% agarose pads in 300 nM sodium azide. Axons were scored as damaged if they were broken or if there was significant beading. All other axons were scored as intact if they traversed completely from the ventral nerve cord to the dorsal nerve cord. The number of cell bodies was counted starting at the tail moving anteriorly toward the head. We observed an average of 15 axons as the 16th most anterior axon was either missing or redirected to the left side of the animal. TIR-1b fluorescence intensity quantification To determine TIR-1b levels in animals expressing unc-47p::tir-1b::mCherry::unc-54 3 UTR , unc-47p::tir-1b(E788A)::mCherry::unc-54 3 UTR , and unc-47p::tir-1b(D773A)::mCherry::unc-54 3 UTR , we quantified fluorescent expression in the posterior seven GABAergic cell bodies. These cell bodies correspond with axons that were severed in the injury assays. Images were taken on a Perkin Elmer Precisely UltraVIEW VoX spinning disc confocal imaging system using a 40x objective. Images were compressed and exported as TIFF files for processing in FIJI. Cell bodies were then traced using the freehand tool in FIJI and the intensity of TIR-1b::mCherry was quantified. Background fluorescence was corrected by quantifying an additional trace next to each cell body. RT-qPCR Strains analyzed: oxIs12(Punc-47::GFP), tir-1(qd4);oxIs12, dlk-1(oe);oxIs12, dlk-1(oe);tir-1(qd4);oxIs12 . RNA isolation: 100 L4 stage animals of each strain were transferred to unseeded NGM plates and transferred to 50 l RNase-free dH 2 O. 500 l of cold TRIZOL was added and samples were frozen in a 80C freezer overnight. The following day, another 500 l of cold TRIZOL reagent was added to each sample. Samples were subjected to three rounds of freeze-thaws that included flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen, thawing in 37C water bath, and vortexing for 30 s. Samples were passed through 18-Gauge syringes 12 times and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4C to remove insoluble material. Supernatant was transferred to fresh microcentrifuge tubes and 200 l of CHCl 3 was added. Tubes were inverted and vortexed for 30 s, incubated at room temperature for 5 min, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4C to separate phases. 500 l of the clear, upper aqueous phase was transferred to fresh microcentrifuge tubes and 500 l isopropanol was added and mixed by pipetting. RNA was isolated with QIAGEN RNeasy purification and eluted with 36 l of RNase-free dH 2 O. cDNA synthesis: reverse transcriptase (RT) synthesized cDNA, and No-RT samples were prepared with NEB LunaScript RT SuperMix kit. The concentration of each was then quantified using a NanoDrop. RT-qPCR analysis: Procedures were followed according to the NEB Luna Universal qPCR kit protocol. Reactions were performed in triplicate, with RT+ template and No-RT template control. RT-qPCR was performed with a Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time System with a C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad QuickCalcs ( https://www.graphpad.com/quickcals/ ) and Prism (GraphPad). Categorical data: Data from repeated assays comparing a mutant and corresponding control strain were pooled for statistical analysis. Bars represent 95% confidence intervals and significance determined with Fishers exact test, where *p0.05, **p0.01, ***0.001, n  30. Continuous data (fluorescence intensity of GFP along axon commissure) are presented as the mean with error bars representing the standard error of the mean. Significance was calculated with Students t -tests, where *p0.05, **0.01, ***0.001.

      "page_content='Title:Genes that act downstream of DAF-16 to influence the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans.\\nAbstract: Ageing is a fundamental, unsolved mystery in biology. DAF-16, a FOXO-family transcription factor, influences the rate of ageing of Caenorhabditis elegans in response to insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I) signalling. Using DNA microarray analysis, we have found that DAF-16 affects expression of a set of genes during early adulthood, the time at which this pathway is known to control ageing. Here we find that many of these genes influence the ageing process. The insulin/IGF-I pathway functions cell non-autonomously to regulate lifespan, and our findings suggest that it signals other cells, at least in part, by feedback regulation of an insulin/IGF-I homologue. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the insulin/IGF-I pathway ultimately exerts its effect on lifespan by upregulating a wide variety of genes, including cellular stress-response, antimicrobial and metabolic genes, and by downregulating specific life-shortening genes.\\nContent:' metadata={'source': '/Users/dan/Code/Python/pub_worm/notebooks/output/PM12845331.txt', 'title': 'Genes that act downstream of DAF-16 to influence the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans.', 'url': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12845331/'}\n"
