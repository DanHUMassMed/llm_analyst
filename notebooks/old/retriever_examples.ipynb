(AP) — An unusual late-summer storm turned a week-long counterculture fest into a sloppy mess with tens of thousands of partygoers stuck in foot-deep mud and with no working toilets in the northern Nevada desert. But some Burning Man revelers said Sunday that their spirits remained unbroken.Organizers closed the festival to vehicles after one death was reported. Officials provided no details of the fatality.The annual gathering in the Black Rock Desert about 110 miles (177 kilometers) north of Reno attracts nearly 80,000 artists, musicians and activists for a mix of wilderness camping and avant-garde performances. Disruptions are part of the event’s recent history: Organizers had to temporarily close entrances to the festival in 2018 due to dust storms, and the event was twice canceled altogether during the pandemic.\\nMore than a half an inch (1.3 centimeters) of rain fell at the festival site on Friday, disrupting this year’s festival.“We are a little bit dirty and muddy but spirits are high. The party still going,” said Scott London, a Southern California photographer, adding that the travel limitations offered “a view of Burning Man that a lot of us don’t get to see.”\\n                    READ MORE\\n                \\nUSPS commits to rerouting Reno-area mail despite bipartisan pushback and mail ballot concerns\\nSierra blizzard provides ammo for critics of US Postal Service plan to downsize mail hub in Nevada\\nStretch of I-80 shut down as monster blizzard dumps snow on mountains in California and Nevada\\nMore than half an inch (1.3 centimeters) of rain and possibly close to 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) fell this weekend in parts of northwest Nevada, which includes the area where the Burning Man festival was being held, said Mark Deutschendorf, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Reno.\\nFor the Reno area, which is about 141 miles (227 km) south of the festival, the average rainfall for the whole month of September would be 0.21 inches (0.53 centimeters), Deutschendorf said.“Already, everywhere from Reno up to the Burning Man area, Black Rock, we’ve already exceeded that — and it’s only three days into the month,” he said. Rainfall for the area around the festival was ending on Sunday, he said.\\nThe road closures came just before a large wooden effigy was supposed to have been burned Saturday night. Organizers said that all burning had been postponed, and authorities were working to open exit routes by the end of the Labor Day weekend.Officials said late Saturday they didn’t yet know when the roads would “be dry enough for RVs or vehicles to navigate safely,” but they were hopeful vehicles could depart by late Monday if weather conditions improved.President Joe Biden told reporters in Delaware on Sunday that he is aware of the situation at Burning Man, including the death, and the White House is in touch with local officials. Biden said he did not know the cause of death. With their party closed to motorized traffic, attendees trudged through mud, many barefoot or with plastic bags on their feet. Revelers were urged to conserve supplies of food and water, and most remained hunkered down at the site.A few, however, managed to walk several miles to the nearest town or catch a ride there.Celebrity DJ Diplo posted a video to Instagram on Saturday evening showing him and comedian Chris Rock riding in the back of a fan’s pickup truck. He said they had walked six miles through the mud before hitching a ride.\\n“I legit walked the side of the road for hours with my thumb out,” wrote Diplo, whose real name is Thomas Wesley Pentz. The event is remote on the best of days and emphasizes self-sufficiency — meaning most people bring in their own food, water and other supplies.Those who remained Sunday described a resilient community making the most of the mucky conditions: Many posted selfies of themselves covered in mud, dancing or splashing in the makeshift lakes.“We have not witnessed any negativity, any rough times,” organizer Theresa Galeani said. “Some people … were supposed to leave a few days ago, so they’re out of water or food. But I am an organizer, so I went around and found more water and food. There is more than enough here for people. We just have to get it to everyone.”London, the Southern California photographer who was attending his 20th Burning Man and just published a book on the festival, “Burning Man: Art On Fire,” spent much of Saturday walking barefoot across the site, which is about 5 square miles. He said that the biggest challenge was logistics because no vehicles could traverse the site, supplies could not be brought in and most people could not leave.\\n“Usually it’s very crowded with art cars, bikes and people all over the place. But yesterday it was like an abandoned playground,” he added.Rebecca Barger, a photographer from Philadelphia, arrived at her first Burning Man on Aug. 26 and was determined to stick it out through the end.“I’m not leaving until both ‘The Man’ and ‘The Temple’ burn,” Barger said, referring to the wooden effigy and wooden structure that are traditionally torched during the event’s last two nights.\\nShe said one of the biggest concerns has been the lack of toilet options because the trucks that normally arrive to clean out the portable toilets multiple times a day haven’t been able to reach the site since Friday’s rainstorm. Some revelers said trucks had resumed cleaning on Sunday.To prevent her shoes from getting stuck in the muddy clay, Barger says she put a plastic bag over each of her shoes and then covered each bag with a sock. Others were just barefoot.“Everyone has just adapted, sharing RVs for sleeping, offering food and coffee,” Barger said. “I danced in foot-deep clay for hours to incredible DJs.” Ed Fletcher of Sacramento, a longtime Burning Man attendee, arrived in Black Rock City over a week ago to start setting up. When the rain hit, he and his campmates threw a party and “danced the night away” in their muddy shoes.“Radical self-reliance is one of the principles of Burning Man,” he said. “The desert will try to kill you in some way, shape or form.”The Pershing County Sheriff’s Office did not release the identity of the deceased person or the suspected cause of death but said it is being investigated.On their website, organizers encouraged participants to remain calm and suggested that the festival is built to endure conditions like the flooding. They said cellphone trailers were being dropped in several locations Saturday night and that they would be briefly opening up internet overnight. Shuttle buses were also being organized to take attendees to Reno from the nearest town of Gerlach, a walk of about five miles (eight kilometers) from the site.The event began on Aug. 27 and had been scheduled to end Monday, according to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which oversees the Black Rock Desert, where the festival was held. John Asselin, a spokesperson for the Bureau of Land Management, said he had seen “a steady stream” of vehicles leaving the festival site.“People are getting out,” he said. \\nThe traffic jam leaving the Burning Man festival eased up considerably Tuesday as the exodus from the mud-caked Nevada desert entered another day following massive rain that left tens of thousands of partygoers stranded for days.

The sheriff’s office says no immediate cause of death was determined after interviewing witnesses and medical responders, but an autopsy toxicology report is still being processed.While some continued their Burning Man experience, celebrity DJ Diplo and comedian Chris Rock decided to walk out. Other attendees did the same, wondering how long they might be stuck on the lake bed known as the playa.\"Everybody at first was like, just welcoming the idea of staying in their trailer, in their camp, and just hanging out, and having, I suppose a continuation of their Burning Man time,\" attendee Griffin Kirsch said. \"And after enough time went by, it started to get a little bit … people started to question like, how long are we going to be sheltering in place here? And that’s when we ultimately made the pretty quick decision to exit and walk out.\"DEATH REPORTED AT BURNING MAN FESTIVAL IN NEVADA AS THOUSANDS OF ATTENDEES GET STRANDED BY MONSOON FLOODING   02:03 Thousands remain trapped after flooding at Burning Man Monsoon rains on Friday and over the weekend caused flash flooding at Burning Man, turning the usually dry, desert landscape of the festival grounds into a muddy mess. Sept. 4, 2023.FOX News Correspondent Claudia Cowan attended the festival and spoke with FOX Weather about the improving conditions. According to Cowan, many festival attendees are attempting to catch international flights to return home. Unlike previous years, where departures occurred over multiple days, this year\\'s attendees are facing a mass exodus as they try to leave the muddy playa.\"Thousands of people would have left on Friday. Thousands would have left on Saturday. Thousands would have left on Sunday,\" Cowan said.Despite the rain and muddy mess, Cowan said \"there was no panic\" when Burners were told to shelter in place. Attendees continued to embrace the \"Burner spirit\" and be kind to their neighbors at the festival through the weather event.\\xa0   04:20 \\'There was no panic\\': Burner spirit prevails during flooding event at Burning Man FOX News Senior Correspondent Claudia Cowen is preparing to leave the Burning Man festival in Nevada after flooding caused festival goers to hunker down and wait for conditions to improve. Cowen said the \"Burner spirit\" prevailed and there was no panic was people waited to leave.People have been asked to delay their departures until Tuesday. The \"Burner Express\" bus service has also started back up again as burners return to society.As Burners left, organizers asked them to be courteous to the neighboring community. What festival attendees bring in must also be brought out when they leave, including trash.\"There is no garbage collection service in BRC. It is up to each of us to remove all Matter Out of Place (MOOP) from our camps and our city,\" Burning Man organizers said.

They said cellphone trailers were being dropped in several locations Saturday night and that they would be briefly opening up internet overnight. Shuttle buses were also being organized to take attendees to Reno from the nearest town of Gerlach, a walk of about five miles (eight kilometers) from the site.\\nREAD MORE: Tropical Storm Hilary leaves desert and mountain towns in muddy mess\\n“Burning Man is a community of people who are prepared to support one another. We have come here knowing this is a place where we bring everything we need to survive,” the organizers said in a statement. “It is because of this that we are all well-prepared for a weather event like this.”\\nCelebrity DJ Diplo posted a video to Instagram on Saturday evening showing him and comedian Chris Rock riding in the back of a fan’s pickup truck. He said they had walked six miles through the mud before hitching a ride.\\n“I legit walked the side of the road for hours with my thumb out,” wrote Diplo, whose real name is Thomas Wesley Pentz.\\nVehicle gates will not open for the remainder of the event, which began on Aug. 27 and was scheduled to end Monday, according to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which oversees the Black Rock Desert where the festival is being held.\\nMore than one-half inch of rain is believed to have fallen on Friday at the festival site, located about 110 miles (177 kilometers) north of Reno, the National Weather Service in Reno said. At least another quarter of an inch of rain is expected Sunday.\\nThe\\xa0Reno Gazette Journal\\xa0reported organizers started rationing ice sales and that all vehicle traffic at the sprawling festival grounds had been stopped, leaving portable toilets unable to be serviced.\\nOfficials said late Saturday the entrance to the event remained closed, and it wasn’t immediately known when celebrants could leave the grounds. No driving is allowed except for emergency vehicles and organizers said they didn’t have a time yet when the roads would “be dry enough for RVs or vehicles to navigate safely.” But if weather conditions improve, they were hopeful vehicles could depart by late Monday.\\nThe announcements came just before the culminating moment for the annual event — when a large wooden effigy was to be burned Saturday night.\\nMessages left Saturday afternoon by The Associated Press for both the Bureau of Land Management and the Pershing County Sheriff’s Office, the agencies that closed the entrance, weren’t immediately returned.\\nMany people played beer pong, danced and splashed in standing water, the Gazette Journal said. Mike Jed, a festivalgoer, and fellow campers made a bucket toilet so people didn’t have to trudge as often through the mud to reach the portable toilets.\\n“If it really turns into a disaster, well, no one is going to have sympathy for us,” Jed said. “I mean, it’s Burning Man.”\\nLeft:\\n                A Burning Man participant makes their way through the mud in Black Rock City, in the Nevada desert, after a rainstorm turned the site into mud, Sept. 2, 2023.

Their motto: “Leave no trace.”This year, thousands got stuck in the mud instead after about a half an inch of rain hit what is normally the driest state in the nation. Instead of leaving no trace, many self-described “burners” abandoned bicycles and vehicles on the drenched, muddy Black Rock Desert.Share CommentsClimate change and global warmingHAND CURATEDPollution fueling a sex imbalance among endangered green sea turtles November 26, 2023Pollution fueling a sex imbalance among endangered green sea turtles November 26, 2023This Fox News host gives climate skeptics airtime but went solar at homeOctober 25, 2023This Fox News host gives climate skeptics airtime but went solar at homeOctober 25, 2023How humans have altered the Earth enough to start a new chapter of geologic timeJune 20, 2023How humans have altered the Earth enough to start a new chapter of geologic timeJune 20, 2023View 3 more storiesSign upTOP STORIESTechnologyBig Tech news and how to take control of your data and devicesDefense think tank MITRE to build AI supercomputer with Nvidia After big weekend in Palm Beach, Trump returns to N.Y. courtroomImproper ‘shadow’ ads thriving on Facebook during India’s electionbackTry a different topicSign in or create a free account to save your preferenceswashingtonpost.com  © 1996-2024 The Washington Postwashingtonpost.com © 1996-2024 The Washington Post\\n'}]"
