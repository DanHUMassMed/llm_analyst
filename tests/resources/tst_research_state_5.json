We\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve been listening to the community and are announcing a re-architecture of the package into multiple packages (done in a completely backwards compatible way), a path towards a stable 0.1 release, and also taking the opportunity to highlight the ecosystem that has emerged around LangChain.TL;DR:We've split the old langchain package into three separate packages to improve developer experiencelangchain-core contains simple, core abstractions that have emerged as a standard, as well as LangChain Expression Language as a way to compose these components together.
