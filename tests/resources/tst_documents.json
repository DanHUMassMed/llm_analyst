SAM is hypothesized to link\nmetabolism and chromatin modification, however, its role in acute gene regulation is poorly\nunderstood. We recently found that Caenorhabditis elegans with reduced SAM had deficien-\ncies in H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) at pathogen-response genes, decreasing their\nexpression and limiting pathogen resistance. We hypothesized that SAM may be generally\nrequired for stress-responsive transcription. Here, using genetic assays, we show that tran-\nscriptional responses to bacterial or xenotoxic stress fail in C. elegans with low SAM, but\nthat expression of heat shock genes are unaffected. We also found that two H3K4 methyl-\ntransferases, set-2/SET1 and set-16/MLL, had differential responses to survival during\nstress. set-2/SET1 is specifically required in bacterial responses, whereas set-16/MLL is\nuniversally required. These results define a role for SAM in the acute stress-responsive\ngene expression. Finally, we find that modification of metabolic gene expression correlates\nwith enhanced survival during stress.\nAuthor summary\nAnimals respond to stress by activating suites of protective genes. A specific metabolite, S-\nadenosylmethionine (SAM), influences how these genes are activated in a variety of stress\nconditions. SAM is produced by the 1-carbon cycle and is the major donor for methyla-\ntion reactions. Thus, SAM is used in the modification of histones, DNA, RNA and pro-\nduction of phospholipids. Here, we show that C. elegans with low SAM have reduced\nresponses to a bacterial and toxic stress, but respond normally to heat stress. We also ana-\nlyzed how animals that have reduced activity in some of the enzymes that use SAM to\nmodify histones might respond to stress. One enzyme, SET-2, was needed only for sur-\nvival in bacterial stress, whereas the other related enzyme, SET-16, was universally\nrequired. The availability of SAM may be affected by diets low in choline or methionine,\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007812\nNovember 28, 2018\n1 / 26\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\nOPEN ACCESS\nCitation: Ding W, Higgins DP, Yadav DK, Godbole\nAA, Pukkila-Worley R, Walker AK (2018) Stress-\nresponsive and metabolic gene regulation are\naltered in low S-adenosylmethionine.

Thus, low SAM availability may leave organisms\nless able to respond to additional stress, which could exacerbate tissue injury or disease\nprogression.\nIntroduction\nCellular functions are profoundly affected by metabolic state. For example, transcriptional reg-\nulation can be linked to metabolism through the modification of chromatin by methylation\n[1]. Using the methyl groups produced by the 1-carbon cycle (1CC) and donated by S-adeno-\nsylmethionine (SAM), histone methyltransferases (HMTs) can change the regulatory state of\nchromatin, promoting or limiting gene activity [2]. HMT activity can be controlled by recruit-\nment of HMT containing complexes to specific genomic locations [2]. However, SAM avail-\nability may also affect histone methylation patterns [3]. SAM is produced by the 1-carbon\ncycle (1CC) and levels can be affected by folate, methionine or choline levels or by other factors\nsuch as alcohol consumption [4]. Variations in SAM levels have been proposed to mediate\ntransgenerational inheritance of epigenetic patterns or other gene regulatory events, however,\na direct mechanistic connection has been difficult to establish [5]. Although SAM is necessary\nfor all histone methylation events, in vivo studies have suggested that particular methylation\nmarks are more sensitive to changes in SAM levels. For example, induced pluripotent stem\ncells (iPSCs), murine liver, and C. elegans all show a decrease in H3K4me3 levels as SAM levels\ndrop [6\u20139]. Furthermore, in budding yeast, a rise in SAM levels is followed by increases in\nH3K4me3 [10]. Furthermore, these linked changes in SAM levels and H3K4me3 also correlate\nwith changes in cell-type-specific gene expression and differentiation in iPS cells [7]. Finally,\nDai et al. have recently demonstrated that treatments with high and low methionine, which is\nthe precursor for SAM, alters H3K4me3 peak width at genes in steady-state conditions in\nmouse liver and human cancer cells [11]. Thus, SAM levels are tightly linked to H3K4me3\ndynamics.\nTrimethylation of H3K4 is a common modification occurring close to the start site of\nactively transcribed genes and is accomplished through the activity of the COMPASS complex\n[12]. The KTM2 family of HMTs serves as the enzymatic activity of COMPASS providing\nmono, di and trimethylated states [13]. In yeast, there is a single member, Set1, whereas mam-\nmals can use one of seven enzymes, within subfamilies of SET1, MLL (Mixed lineage leukemia)\nor THX (Trithorax) [12]. However, the relationship between H3K4me3 and transcription is\ncomplex, as it does not appear to be necessary for global gene expression in basal conditions\n[14]. In yeast, Set1 has an important role in limiting the expression of ribosomal genes during\nthe response to diamide stress [15] suggesting that chromatin-modifying factors are especially\ncritical when organisms experience stress. The H3K4 methyltransferase family in mammals\nappears to have overlapping as well as specialized functions in either specificity for mono, di or\ntri-methylation or through distinct roles in development [13]. However, clearly defined roles\nfor each MT have been difficult to discern.\nC. elegans genome encodes a simplified KTM2 family containing three H3K4 methyltrans-\nferases, set-2/SET1, set-16/MLL and ash-2/THX [16]. Interestingly, these methyltransferases\nhave distinct developmental and tissue-specific biological functions. set-2/SET1 is broadly\nimportant for H3K4 trimethylation in embryos and the germline [17, 18] and the intestine [8].\nAlso, loss or reduction of set-2/SET1 influences fertility across generations [19], lifespan [20]\nand lipid accumulation [21]. ash-2 acts through the germline to affect lifespan and lipid accu-\nmulation in the intestine [20\u201322]. set-16/MLL, on the other hand, appears to be dispensable\nLow SAM alters stress-induced gene expression\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007812\nNovember 28, 2018\n2 / 26\nanalysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the\nmanuscript.\nCompeting interests: The authors have declared\nthat no competing interests exist.\n",

        "raw_content": "for H3K4me3 in the early embryo and germline (Li, 2011), while we found that it has a partial\nrequirement in the adult intestine [8]. Thus, while H3K4me3 marks the start sites of actively\ntranscribed genes, the methyltransferases producing it can have diverse and long-acting bio-\nlogical effects.\nUsing a C. elegans model of low SAM, we previously found that transcriptional responses to\na bacterial pathogen failed and these bacterial-response genes did not show the normal pattern\nof H3K4me3 close to the transcriptional start sites, [8]. We also found that the HMT set-16/\nMLL was required for full induction, whereas set-2/SET1 appeared dispensable [8]. We\nhypothesized that animals with low SAM might fail to transcriptionally respond to stress and\nthat the HMTs may also have distinct roles in modulating stress responses. In our present\nstudy, we set out to compare induction of transcriptional responses and survival upon stress\nexposure between C. elegans with reduced SAM and animals with limited H3K4me3 function.\nBecause distinct stresses may rely on different transcriptional activation mechanisms, we also\ncompared whole-genome expression patterns in three stresses: pathogenic bacteria, xenotoxic\nand heat. We found that the induction of genes in the pathogen and xenotoxic stress response\nwere diminished in low SAM, with concomitant reductions in survival in these animals. How-\never, while pathogen and xenotoxic-stress genes were affected after both set-2/SET1 and set-\n16/MLL RNAi, set-16/MLL was uniquely required for survival in all three stresses. This sug-\ngests SAM and set-16 have essential functions in transcriptional responses to diverse stresses.\nInterestingly, induction of heat stress response genes, which are controlled primarily by pro-\nmoter pausing of RNA Pol II [23], occurs even in low SAM and after H3K4 methytransferase\nknockdown. While expression of canonical heat shock genes occurred in each of these condi-\ntions, sams-1 animals fared better than controls, set-2 animals survived at control levels and\nset-16 animals died rapidly. Thus, the expression of stress response genes and survival may not\ncorrelate in all cases. Finally, we find that in addition to stress-responsive genes, regulation of\nmetabolic genes may be key to the survival of animals with deficient H3K4 methylation during\nstress.\nResults\nLarge-scale changes in stress-induced gene expression in low SAM\nGene regulatory events can be controlled by histone methylation; however, it is not clear how\nlevels of the methyl donor SAM may alter methylation patterns and gene expression in differ-\nent physiological conditions (Fig 1A). In C. elegans, we previously found animals with a muta-\ntion in the SAM synthase sams-1, which have 50% of the SAM of wild-type animals [24], had\npoor survival on the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa [8]. SAM deficient animals\nfailed to upregulate selected pathogen-response genes and had reduced global H3K4 trimethy-\nlation in intestinal nuclei as well as at specific pathogen-response genes [8]. We hypothesized\nthis could represent a general failure of stress-responsive gene expression, as low SAM levels\nwere unable to support rapid remodeling of H3K4 methylation as transcriptional needs\nchanged. To test this model (Fig 1B), we used RNAi to knockdown sams-1 or the H4K4me3\nmethyltransferases (HMTs) that use SAM, set-2 and set-16, then exposed animals to three\nstresses: bacterial (P. aeruginosa) xenotoxic, or heat. For xenotoxic stress, we used R24, an\nagent that robustly stimulates both immune and detoxification responses in C. elegans [25\u2013\n27]. Next, we used whole genome RNA sequencing to determine which genes changed in each\nstress and assayed how they were affected by low SAM or depletion of the HMTs and selected\ngenes with greater than two-fold change in any of the conditions with a false discovery rate\n(FDR) of <0.01 for further analysis. To determine if gene expression patterns were shared\nbetween control, sams-1, set-2 and set-16 animals in response to P. aeruginosa, we mapped\nLow SAM alters stress-induced gene expression\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007812\nNovember 28, 2018\n3 / 26\n",

We found distinct, large scale gene expression changes with each stress, sug-\ngesting gene expression modules were specified by stress-specific mechanisms rather than by\nSAM or these H3K4 methyltransferases.\nRole of SAM in gene expression and H3K4 methylation in basal conditions\nWe first examined gene expression changes between control and sams-1(RNAi) in non-\nstressed conditions (basal). SAM may contribute to PC production as well as to histone meth-\nylation (S2A Fig) and several lines of evidence from our previous study of gene allow us to dis-\ntinguish indirect effects downstream of phospholipid methylation from other SAM-dependent\nevents. In basal conditions, several hundred genes changed by more than two-fold after sams-1\n(RNAi) (S2B Fig, S1 Table), with significant overlap with our previous microarray results [8].\nIn that study, we found that most gene expression changes were linked to methylation-depen-\ndent PC production, as they were returned to wild-type levels when PC levels were rescued by\ndietary choline (S2C Fig) [8]. Stress-responsive genes activated downstream of PC were (1)\nexpressed at low levels (2\u20135 fold) and (2) expression was returned to wild-type levels by dietary\ncholine, which rescued PC levels [8]. This is in contrast to activation of bacterial stress-respon-\nsive genes by P. aeruginosa, which was dynamic (up to 250 fold) and not responsive to choline\n[8]. Our observation that P. aeruginosa-responsive gene expression also depended on H3K4\nmethyltransferases suggests that stress responsive transcription might have a distinct require-\nment for SAM and H3K4 methyltransferases than in basal conditions. Finally, decreases in\nH3K4me3 in C. elegans intestinal nuclei were not rescued when choline returned PC to wild\ntype levels, suggesting that SAM-dependent decreases in this histone methylation mark are not\nlinked to indirect effects from PC.\nBoth H3K4 methylation and PC production are significant consumers of SAM [3] (S2A\nFig). Recently Ye, et al. show that H3K4 tri-methylation can increase in Saccharomyces cerevi-\nsiae when PC production is blocked and SAM levels increase [10]. In agreement with these\nfindings, we also observed that global H3K4me3 levels increase when the PC-producing\nmethyltransferases pmt-2 was knocked down (S2D Fig). Thus, in basal conditions, gene\nexpression changes to compensate for decreases in PC are the predominant effect of sams-1\nloss, with negligible effects due to other methylation pathways. Finally, modified H3K4 may\nexist in several methylation states [13]. Using immunostaining with antibodies to H3K4me1\nand H3K4me2, we found that levels did not decrease as they had with H3K4me3 (S2E Fig;\n[8]), suggesting that the trimethylated state is most sensitive to SAM levels in adult C. elegans\nintestine.\nSAM is important for the transcriptional response to a bacterial stress\nNext, we compared gene expression patterns in control, sams-1, set-2 and set-16 RNAi animals\nduring P. aeruginosa exposure. Control animals upregulated 651 genes more than two-fold in\nresponse to the bacterial stress (Fig 2A and 2B, S2 Table) with a high concordance to previous\nstudies that identified P. aeruginosa-response genes [28, 29] (S2 Table).

Focusing on the top\n20 expressed genes in control animals, we find a significant reduction in expression (Fig 2B)\nand finally, we find that few genes outside the pathogen response are induced after sams-1\nRNAi (Fig 2C). The transcriptional response to P. aeruginosa also includes downregulation of\na small subset of genes [28]. Comparisons between control and sams-1(RNAi) gene expression\npatterns show that a proportion of the top 20 downregulated genes in control animals fail to\ndecrease after sams-1 RNAi (S3A Fig) and that only about 5 percent of these genes overlap\n(S3B Fig). Thus, this whole genome data confirms our analysis of selected P. aeruginosa-\nresponsive genes [8] and shows that SAM is essential for the broad transcriptional changes\noccurring during stress caused by a pathogenic bacteria, reducing both total numbers of regu-\nlated genes and their magnitude.\nTranscriptional responses and survival upon xenobiotic challenge are\ndiminished in low SAM\nTo determine how sams-1 RNAi animals respond to a distinct stress, we treated control and\nsams-1 RNAi animals with R24, a xenotoxic agent that induces both detoxification and innate\nimmune defenses [25\u201327]. R24 was originally identified in a screen of 37,200 small molecules\nthat utilized C. elegans as a heterologous host to identify new anti-infective compounds[30].\nInterestingly, R24 protects nematodes from bacterial infection by boosting the transcription of\ninnate immune defenses [26, 27]. This molecule is also toxic to worms growing under normal\nlaboratory conditions. Exposure to R24 strongly activates the transcription of cytochrome\nP450 and other detoxification genes, it shortens nematode lifespan and delays worm develop-\nment [26, 27]. We used R24 as a tool to compare gene expression changes in animals with low\namounts of SAM. RNA-seq was performed on control and sams-1(RNAi) after treatment with\nR24. A set of genes was significantly upregulated by R24 in wild-type animals, which was con-\nsistent with published results [25\u201327]. Importantly, the induction of genes by R24 was signifi-\ncantly attenuated in sams-1(RNAi) animals (Fig 3A, S3 Table). The 20 most highly induced\ngenes after R24 treatment included multiple cytochrome p450s as well as previously identified\npathogen response genes (Fig 3B) [27]. Strip plots comparing levels in control and sams-1\n(RNAi) animals show that each gene was markedly decreased (Fig 3B). We also found that\nmost of the genes induced in sams-1 animals were part of the response to R24 in control ani-\nmals (Fig 3C). R24 also induces the downregulation of a limited subset of genes [27]. Compari-\nson between genes downregulated in control animal or after sams-1 RNAi shows that sams-1\nRNAi also limits this downregulation (S3C and S3D Fig). Thus, low SAM attenuates the tran-\nscriptional response to a xenotoxic agent, just as it does to bacterial stress-responsive gene\nexpression induced by P. aeruginosa.\nHeat shock transcriptional response occurs independently of SAM\nTranscriptional response to bacteria or xenotoxic agents are predicted to follow a classic signal\ntransduction pathway where the extracellular stimulus activates a cellular signaling pathway\nlinked to individual transcription factors and upregulation of stress-specific gene expression\n[31].

To determine if low SAM had the same effects\non heat shock-dependent transcription as the bacterial or xenotoxic stress, we performed\nwhole genome RNA sequencing on control, sams-1, set-2 and set-16 RNAi animals exposed to\n37\u02daC for one hour. We found that heat-shock genes such as hsp-16.41, hsp-16.2, hsp-16-11,\nhsp-16.48, hsp-16.49 and hsp-70 were strongly induced in control animals in these conditions\n(Fig 3D\u20133F, S4 Table).\nIn contrast to the bacterial or xenotoxic stress responses, comparison of control and sams-1\npatterns for genes induced at least 2-fold shows similar patterns (Fig 3D), suggesting that\nreduced SAM availability does not compromise the activation of heat-stress induced genes.\nStrip plots comparing expression of the top 20 genes activated in control animals compared to\nsams-1 shows that most of the highly expressed genes are similarly or more highly expressed\nafter sams-1 RNAi (Fig 3E). Finally, Venn diagrams confirm that the genes upregulated after\nheat shock in controls are also upregulated in sams-1 animals and that many genes ectopic to\nthe heat shock response also increase (Fig 3F), suggesting that additional gene expression are\nactivated in sams-1 animals under heat stress. Control animals downregulated approximately\n300 genes after heat shock; strikingly, nearly 2000 genes decreased in parallel sams-1 RNAi ani-\nmals (S3E and S3F Fig). Thus, while expression of heat shock genes seems to occur indepen-\ndently of SAM, other genes outside this classical response dramatically increase or decrease\nduring heat shock in low SAM.\nDifferential attenuation of stress-responses after knockdown of the H3K4\nmethyltransferases set-2\nHistone methyltransferases use SAM to modify specific histone residues, modifying the chro-\nmatin environment to provide distinct gene regulatory states. Yeast contain a single H3K4\nHMT, which provides mono, di and trimethylated states [12] and functions within the COM-\nPASS HMT complex. Mammals encode 7 H3K4 HMTs that have different specificity for meth-\nylation states [12]. However, the non-redundant biological functions have been difficult to\ndiscern. C. elegans contains 3 H3K4 HMTs that affect H4K4me3, set-2/SET1, set-16/MLL and\nash-2/THX. These HMTs affect embryonic and germline development [17, 18] and transge-\nnerational inheritance through the germline [20, 22]. In our previous studies, we investigated\nthe roles of set-2/SET1 and set-16/MLL in the adult C. elegans intestine, which is a critical tis-\nsue in the pathogen response [33]. Because H3K4me3 has been associated with dynamically\ntranscribed genes and our previous results showing an increase in H3K4 tri-methylation at\npromoters of selected P. aeruginosa responsive genes during infection [8], we sought to deter-\nmine if set-2/SET1 or set-16/MLL were downstream of SAM-dependent responses during the\nstress response. Neither set-2 or set-16 RNAi significantly affected gene expression in non-\nstressed conditions (S4A and S4B Fig, S1 Table). In parallel with sams-1(RNAi) RNA experi-\nments (Figs 1 and 2), we exposed set-2(RNAi) animals to P. aeruginosa, the xenotoxic agent\nR24 or heat stress, extracted RNA and performed RNA-sequencing. Unbiased hierarchical\nclustering analysis of all genes significantly upregulated by any of these stresses showed that\nset-2 and set-16 RNAi grouped within each stress, suggesting similar overall gene expression\npatterns (Fig 2A). Next, we used the same computational tools as in the sams-1 analysis to\ncompare expression patterns of P. aeruginosa response genes after set-2 RNAi.\nInterestingly, although heat maps show that activation of bacterial-stress responsive genes\nare diminished after set-2 RNAi, the effect is less severe than in sams-1(RNAi) animals (Fig\nshows that the top 20 genes expressed after heat shock are upregulated similarly in control and sams-1(RNAi) animals.

Analysis of the genes two-fold\ndownregulated in control animals shows that most of the genes were reduced at similar levels\nafter set-2 RNAi and were part of the same transcriptional response (S4A and S4B Fig). Taken\ntogether, this data suggests that set-2 RNAi mediates part of the response to P. aeruginosa in\nlow SAM.\nLow SAM decreased the ability of C. elegans to respond transcriptionally to xenobiotic R24\n(Fig 3A\u20133C). Interestingly, knockdown of set-2 mirrored sams-1 RNAi in some respects, but\nnot others. Like sams-1, heat maps show that set-2 RNAi limited the number of genes upregu-\nlated by more than two-fold (Fig 3A, S3 Table). As with the response to P. aeruginosa, set-2\nRNAi animals show reductions in several of the top 20 R24-induced genes and have dimin-\nished genome-wide expression of R24 response genes (Fig 4C). However, a set of 135 genes\nwere induced in response to R24 in set-2 RNAi animals that were not upregulated in control\nsamples (Fig 4D), suggesting deregulation or expansion of the transcriptional response.\nNext, we examined the response to heat stress after set-2 RNAi and found similarities with\nthe sams-1 response. First, many genes induced more than twofold are similar in set-2 RNAi\nand controls (Fig 3D, S4 Table). Second, although most of the top 20 genes upregulated in\ncontrol animals were expressed after set-2 RNAi at near normal levels (Fig 4F). Strikingly,\nmany genes ectopic to the control response were induced after set-2 RNAi (Fig 4G). As in the\nupregulated gene sets, the downregulated genes in control animals in response to heat also\ndecreased after set-2 RNAi. However, a large number of genes not downregulated in controls\nalso decreased (S5E and S5F Fig). Thus, set-2 appear to be important for full response to P.\naeruginosa or R24, but dispensable for genes induced by heat in control animals. Interestingly,\nknockdown of this H3K4 methyltransferase appears to deregulate or expand the stress\nresponse to both R24 and heat.\nDifferential attenuation of stress-responses after knockdown of the H3K4\nmethyltransferases set-16\nLike set-2/SET1, set-16/MLL is important for H3K4me3 in the C. elegans intestine [8]. In addi-\ntion, we identified a critical role for set-16 in mediating P. aeruginosa-responsive gene regula-\ntion in our previous studies [8]. Therefore, we also compared bacterial, xenotoxic and heat\nstress induction in knockdown of set-16 to set-2 and sams-1. Confirming our previous qPCR\nanalysis of selected P. aeruginosa-responsive genes in set-16 RNAi animals, we found that set-\n16 was broadly important for expression of genes upregulated by bacterial stress (Fig 2A).\nMany of the highest expressed genes in control animals during the P. aeruginosa response\nwere diminished after set-16(RNAi) (Fig 5A, S3 Table). Finally, most of the genes upregulated\nby P. aeruginosa in set-16 RNAi animals were also upregulated in control samples (Fig 5B). A\nproportion of the genes downregulated by P. aeruginosa in control animals were also downre-\ngulated in set-16 RNAi animals (S6A and S6B Fig). Thus, sams-1, set-2, and set-16 all appear\nto have critical roles in regulating genes in response to bacterial stress in C. elegans.\nResponses to R24 in set-16(RNAi) animals largely mirrored sams-1 knockdown but were\ndistinct from set-2. Both the number of expressed genes and the levels of the highest expressed\ngenes were significantly decreased (Figs 3A, 5C and 5D). Finally, the majority of genes that\nincreased in set-16(RNAi) animals also increased in controls (Fig 5D). The majority of the\ngenes downregulated by R24 in control animals were not similarly downregulated after set-16\nRNAi (S6C and S6D Fig) As in sams-1 and set-2 knockdown, the top twenty expressed genes\nLow SAM alters stress-induced gene expression\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007812\nNovember 28, 2018\n10 / 26\n",

Like sams-1(RNAi) or set-2(RNAi), set-16\nanimals upregulated and downregulated genes whose expression were not part of the response\nin control animals (Fig 5I; S5E and S5F Fig). Taken together, our results suggest that low\nSAM, decreased set-2/SET1 and set-16/MLL activity all compromise bacterial stress-induced\ngene expression. Xenotoxic stress induced by R24 appeared to have a stronger requirement for\nsams-1 or set-16, with many ectopic genes upregulated in the set-2 response to R24. Finally,\ngenes activated by heat shock appeared mostly unaffected by low SAM, decreased set-2/SET1\nor set-16/MLL activity, suggesting that neither SAM or these HMTs are essential for their\nexpression. However, each displayed a significant number of ectopic genes inductions in both\nup- and down-regulated gene sets. This suggests that complex regulatory interactions may lie\ndownstream of SAM or the H3K4 tri-methylases during the heat shock response. These could\ninclude regulation of downstream transcription factors, methylation of other histone or DNA\ntargets or methylation-independent activity of COMPASS complexes [12].\nSurvival of set-2 and set-16 RNAi animals differs during bacterial,\nxenotoxic or heat stress\nWe found that sams-1, set-2, and set-16 were all required for the transcriptional response to\nbacterial stress, but differentially affected the response to the xenotoxic agent R24. Moreover,\nalthough sams-1, set-2, and set-16 were not required for heat shock gene expression, a varied\nbut significant number of ectopic genes increased or decreased expression when knockdown\nanimals were subjected to heat shock. Next, we sought to determine how low SAM or H3K4\nHMT knockdown affected survival during each stress response. Previously, we found that\nsams-1(lof) animals had poor survival on P. aeruginosa, which was matched by attenuated\nexpression of bacterial-stress responsive genes, and impairment H3K4me3 acquisition at bac-\nterial-stress responsive genes after infection [8]. To determine if set-2 or set-16(RNAi) animals\nshared this susceptibility to bacterial stress, we challenged control and knockdown animals\nwith P. aeruginosa and determined survival rates. Concordant with the whole genome RNA\nsequencing data (Figs 4A\u20134C and 5A\u20135C), we found that both set-2 and set-16(RNAi) animals\nhad significantly reduced survival on P. aeruginosa (Fig 6A, S5 Table).\nOur whole-genome expression analysis showed that many of the genes upregulated in con-\ntrol animals were part of the well-described transcriptional response to P. aeruginosa [28].\nHowever, we also noted other gene sets that could have essential survival functions. When\nusing GO term analysis with the Gorilla website (http://cbl-gorilla.cs.technion.ac.il/), we found\nthat 32% of recognized genes were not associated with a GO term (S7 Fig). Thus, we built an\nannotation tool, Worm-Cat to categorize a more complete list of C. elegans genes and deter-\nmine gene enrichment scores through Fisher\u2019s exact test. Worm-Cat allows assignment of\nbroad physiological or molecular categories (i.e., stress response), and then subsequently iden-\ntifies specific sub-categories (pathogen, heavy metal, etc.) (See S6 Table for annotation table).\nIf genes do not have a clear physiological function or are pleiotropic, molecular functions were\nused. We validated this tool by comparison with GO analysis of our previously published\nthat the majority of genes upregulated after set-2(RNAi) in response to P. aeruginosa were also upregulated in controls. (C) Strip-plot shows that many of the\ntop 20 genes induced by R24 in control animals are reduced after set-2 RNAi. (D) Venn diagram shows that set-2(RNAi) animals induce many genes outside\nthe response to R24 seen in control animals.

The most significant categories,\nsuch as stress response pathogen in sbp-1(RNAi) and sams-1(RNAi) upregulated genes or fatty\nacid metabolic genes in sbp-1(RNAi) down, or sams-1(RNAi) upregulated genes were identi-\nfied by GO and by WORMCAT. While transcriptional regulation was identified by GO ontog-\neny for sams-1(RNAi) upregulated genes, our tool showed a breakdown showing an\nenrichment for nuclear hormone receptors, providing additional specificity. This tool was also\nable to show enrichment for regulation of 1CC genes in sbp-1 downregulated genes, which we\nhad previously noted [24], but were not identified by GO ontogeny. Thus, this tool increases\nthe depth and specificity of gene function in comparison to GO term enrichment.\nWe used Worm-Cat to determine the major categories of genes that were changed in con-\ntrol, sams-1, set-2 or set-16 RNAi animals, then determined which categories matched survival\npatterns. In large sets of regulated genes, super enrichment can be a valuable tool for assessing\nthe role of genes with the largest difference in gene expression patterns [34]. Therefore, we\ndetermined enrichment scores for both 2 fold and 4 fold enriched genes (Fig 6B\u20136D and S8\nTable). Although stress-responsive genes were still enriched after sams-1, set-2 or set-16 RNAi,\nboth the enrichment score and gene number were reduced at both the Category 1 (Fig 6B)\nand more specific Category 2 levels (Fig 6C, S8 Table). Surprisingly, metabolic genes were a\nsignificant fraction of genes upregulated in control animals and less enriched after sams-1, set-\n2 or set-16 RNAi (Fig 6B), correlating with poor survival of these animals. A breakdown of\nspecific categories of metabolic genes showed that lipid metabolism was a significant category\nin control animals and that there were fewer genes and lower enrichment scores after sams-1,\nset-2 or set-16 RNAi. Interestingly, fatty acid desaturases have been linked to response of C. ele-\ngans to P. aeruginosa [25]. In addition, 1CC genes are among those downregulated by C. ele-\ngans during P. aeruginosa infection ([28], see also S8 Table)). Taken together, this suggests\nmetabolic regulation may be an important part of these bacterial stress response.\nR24 is a xenotoxic agent that activates both immune and detoxification responses [25\u201327].\nWe found that transcriptional responses to R24 were distinct in sams-1, set-2, and set-16 ani-\nmals, with genes ectopic to the control xenotoxic stress response increasing in set-2 RNAi ani-\nmals (Fig 3A\u20133C; Fig 4D\u20134F; Fig 5D\u20135F). To determine how sams-1, set-2 and set-16\nknockdown affected survival, we treated animals with R24 and monitored death rates. We\nfound that knockdown of sams-1, set-2, and set-16 had differential susceptibility to R24-medi-\nated toxicity. First, we found that concordant with the reduced expression of xenotoxic agent-\nresponse genes, sams-1 and set-16 had poor survival rates, with set-16 animals showing a par-\nticularly sharp decline (Fig 6E, S9 Table). Knockdown of set-2, however, did not decrease sur-\nvival. Next, we used Worm-Cat to identify gene categories that might correlate with sensitivity\nto the xenotoxic agent in sams-1 and set-16 animals, or survival in the set-2 cohort. First, we\nnoticed that as expected, stress-response genes were the most enriched category in control ani-\nmals, with fewer genes in the sensitive sams-1 or set-16 animals (Fig 6F, S10 Table). Break-\ndown of stress categories shows that R24-induced genes are enriched for cytochrome P450\ngenes and pathogen response genes (Fig 6G), as expected for R24 [25\u201327]. However, the\nknockdowns most sensitive to R24 (sams-1 and set-16) differed slightly in their stress response\nprofiles. After RNAi of sams-1, both CYP450 and pathogen response gene categories loose\nof genes upregulated after set-16(RNAi) in response to P. aeruginosa were also upregulated in controls. (C) Strip-plot shows that the majority of the top 20\ngenes induced by R24 in control animals are reduced after set-16 RNAi. (D) Venn diagram shows that genes induced by more than two-fold set-16(RNAi)\nanimals are also induced in controls.

However, set-16 lost enrichment only within the pathogen\ncategory (Fig 6G, S10 Table), suggesting that genes within the pathogen response category\nmay be important for survival on R24. Supporting this notion, set-2, which survived normally,\nlost CYP450 enrichment but retained genes in the pathogen response category (Fig 6G, S10\nTable). We also noted that metabolic categories were also limited in the sensitive strains. Meta-\nbolic genes, particularly in the lipid metabolism category were significantly enriched in Con-\ntrol and set-2 RNAi animals after R24 treatment, but enrichment scores failed significance\nafter sams-1 or set-16 RNAi (Fig 6F and 6H, S10 Table). This suggests that as in the bacterial\nstress response, rewiring metabolic genes correlates with stress survival. Notably, an RNAi\nscreen for R24-dependent regulators of the innate immune response gene irg-4 identified mul-\ntiple genes involved in fatty acid synthesis [25]. Finally, we found that genes deregulated in set-\n2(RNAi) animals were enriched for genes activated by multiple stresses (Fig 6F, S10 Table).\nHowever, since these genes have no other functional classification, their importance of this\ngene set is unclear.\nSAM and the H3K4 methyltransferases set-2 and set-16 are differently\nrequired for survival during heat stress\nTranscription of heat shock genes in response to high temperature is controlled by shifting\nRNA pol II from a paused to the elongating form at heat shock response genes [32]. To provide\na comparison to bacterial or xenotoxin-induced stress, we compared heat-shock responsive\ntranscription in low SAM or after knockdown of the set-2/SET1 or set-16/MLL methyltrans-\nferases to transcriptional changes occurring after bacterial or xenotoxic stress responses. Strik-\ningly, we found that many genes ectopic to the control heat shock response were activated or\nrepressed after sams-1, set-2 or set-16 RNAi (Figs 3D\u20133F, 4H\u20134J and 5H\u20135J). Next, we per-\nformed survival assays to determine if these gene expression changes altered survival of these\nanimals during stress. Unlike the bacterial stress response, sams-1, set-2, and set-16 all had dis-\ntinct survival curves. First, sams-1 animals were markedly resistant during the first half of the\nassay, with the survival percentage at the assay midpoint more than twice that of control ani-\nmals (Fig 7A, S11 Table). The endpoint of the assay, however, was close to controls. Second,\nas in R24 assays, set-2 animals survived most similar to controls, although p values showed a\nsignificant difference (Figs 6A and 7A, S11 Table). Finally, set-16 RNAi caused an extreme\nsensitivity to heat stress (Fig 7A, S11 Table), similar to P. aeruginosa and R24 responses.\nTo determine if categories of genes expressed in the sams-1, set-2 or set-16 RNAi animals\ncorrelated with the differential survival, we used Worm-Cat to survey the enriched and super\nenriched heat responsive genes. As expected from our initial analysis, significant numbers of\nstress-responsive genes were enriched in the upregulated sams-1, set-2 and set-16 RNAi\ncohorts (Fig 7B and 7C, S12 Table). Genes in chromatin structure were also enriched in all\nbut sams-1 RNAi animals (Fig 7B and 7D, S12 Table). However, none of these category clus-\nters correlated with survival.

        "raw_content": "canonical heat shock genes did not correlate with survival, we found enrichment in other func-\ntional categories. There were several categories of enriched genes (transmembrane transport,\nproteolysis, and protein modification) among the sams-1, set-2 or set-16 RNAi animals (Fig\n7E, S12 Table). However, two categories correlated best with survival: metabolism and tran-\nscription factors. Strikingly, metabolism was only enriched as a downregulated category in\nsams-1(RNAi) animals during heat shock, with the majority of these genes in anabolic path-\nways such as lipid and amino acid metabolism (Fig 7E and 7F; S12 Table). This is distinct\nfrom PC-dependent effects from sams-1 in basal conditions, where fatty acid genes are acti-\nvated (see S7 Table, S12 Table). C. elegans contains a major expansion of nuclear hormone\nreceptors, many of which are thought to regulate metabolic processes [35]. Intriguingly, we\nalso observed reduced NHR gene expression sams-1(RNAi) animals (Fig 7G, S12 Table), con-\ncomitant with the loss of metabolic gene expression. Finally, we find that regulation of meta-\nbolic gene expression also correlates with survival in heat stress, as it did in our bacterial or\nxenotoxic stress assays, suggesting metabolic flexibility may be a common effector in stress\nresponse survival (S8 Fig).\nDiscussion\nMetabolites that contribute to cellular regulatory functions, such as the methyl donor SAM,\ncould be predicted to have broad effects on transcription. Indeed, SAM has been proposed as a\nlink between nutrition and regulation of the 1CC to transgenerational epigenetic effects [5].\nHowever, work from several labs across multiple systems has shown that SAM has surprisingly\nspecific effects on histone methylation, reducing or increasing H3K4me3 as levels fall or rise\n[6\u20139]. Since H3K4me3 is tightly associated with start sites of actively transcribed genes, this\nsuggests SAM may also have a critical role in acute gene regulatory events. Recently, the Loca-\nsale lab has shown that H3K4me3 peak breadth is sensitive to methionine levels in mouse liver\nand human cancer cells, strengthening the connections between SAM and H3K4me3 in vivo\n[11].\nIn this study, we have defined a role for SAM in the regulation of two stress responses, bac-\nterial and xenotoxic stress, and found that it is necessary for induction of specific response\ngenes, as well as for survival. This link between 1-carbon metabolism and stress responses has\nimportant implications for how organisms can respond to stress when metabolically chal-\nlenged. Interestingly, while heat shock genes were expressed independently of SAM, many\nother genes had altered expression patterns in heat shocked sams-1(RNAi) animals which sur-\nvived better than wild type. This suggests multiple independently regulated modules can con-\ntribute to survival. While the expression of heat-shock response genes at control levels in sams-\n1(RNAi) animals suggest these are regulated independently of SAM, the ectopically regulated\ngenes could respond to SAM from direct or indirect mechanisms. For example, Labbadia and\nMorimoto have recently shown that in C. elegans, non-cell autonomous mechanisms linked to\nrepressive H3K27me3 limit stress responses when reproduction starts [36]. Thus, this ectopic\nFig 7. Down-regulation of metabolic gene regulation is linked to survival after heat stress in low SAM or H3K4 MT knockdown.

        "raw_content": "gene activation in sams-1(RNAi) animals could result from changes in repressive methylation\non other histones, on DNA or through other indirect effects.\nOur Worm-Cat annotation tool has shown that downregulation of two classes of genes cor-\nrelates with survival of sams-1 RNAi animals under heat shock: metabolic genes (amino acid,\nlipid and beta-oxidation) and nuclear hormone receptors. We hypothesize that downregulat-\ning these categories pauses anabolic processes and allows a survival advantage for sams-1 ani-\nmals as they respond to heat stress. Interestingly, fatty acid synthesis genes are upregulated\nafter sams-1 RNAi in basal conditions, as changes in PC levels activate the lipogenic transcrip-\ntion factor SBP-1 [24]. As in our study of low SAM on C. elegans on normal laboratory diet of\nE. coli or P. aeruginosa where we found differential effects on activation or repression of patho-\ngen response genes [8], this suggest the effects of low SAM may differ in distinct stress or\nnutritional conditions. Future metabolomic studies will be important for how these changes in\nmetabolic gene expression are linked to survival during heat stress. Nuclear hormone receptors\nare common regulators of metabolic genes [35], and while direct relationships between these\nnuclear hormone receptors and the metabolic genes identified in our study are not yet discern-\nable, it is intriguing that both classes of these genes are downregulated in the surviving animals.\nThus, low SAM may have both direct and indirect effects that influence gene expression and\nsurvival during stress responses.\nSAM is utilized by HMTs such as set-2/SET1 or set-16/MLL to produce methyl marks such\nas H3K4me3. Intriguingly, KTM2s are among the most sensitive HMTs to SAM levels [5].\nSET1 is the single H3K4me3 in yeast, and thus essential for all H3K4 methylation [12]. Neither\nset1 or H3K4 tri-methylation are essential for viability under standard conditions [14]. How-\never, set1 appears to function to limit the expression of ribosomal genes during the response to\ndiamide [15]. The mammalian methyltransferase family is complex with seven H3K4 methyl-\ntransferases that differ in specificity for mono, di or trimethylation [12]. However, it has been\ndifficult to assign specific biological functions. In C. elegans where the KTM2 family is simpler,\nwe have found that set-2 or set-16 RNAi mirrors some of the effects of low SAM, reducing\ntranscriptional responses to multiple stresses. However, set-2/SET1 and set-16/MLL appeared\nto have distinct functional profiles during these stress responses. set-2/SET1 RNAi is similar to\nlow SAM in response to bacterial stress. Some SAM-dependent P. aeruginosa responsive genes\nare also limited in expression after set-2 RNAi, and set-2 animals survive poorly. Our previous\nanalysis of the P. aeruginosa response in set-2 and set-16 animals suggested that set-2 may have\na more limited role [8]. The present whole genome study also bears out an essential role for\nset-16 in P. aeruginosa-responsive transcription, but notably, set-2 animals are also survived\npoorly on P. aeruginosa, suggesting that critical genes are limited in both cases. However, set-2\nappears less critical for some genes in the detoxification response to R24. Survival is close to\nwild-type, and intriguingly, metabolic genes related to lipid synthesis are upregulated, distinct\nfrom the control response. Like the response to low SAM during heat shock, set-2 RNAi did\nnot limit expression of genes induced by heat shock in control animals while many genes were\nde-repressed or ectopically regulated outside the response in controls. As with R24, set-2 RNAi\nanimals survived similar to controls during heat stress. Therefore changes in gene expression\ndid not impact these biological functions. set-2 also has intriguing functions during lifespan\nregulation in C. elegans. Greer et al. showed transgenerational effects on lifespan in set-2\nmutants, and another study from the Brunet lab suggested that set-2 and another H3K4 HMT\n(ash-2) linked lipid synthesis and lifespan regulation [21]. They found that ash-2 was impor-\ntant for non-cell autonomous germline to intestine regulation of these processes [21]. How-\never, the role of set-2 in direct regulation was less clear. Notably, in our study, although lipid\nbiosynthetic genes were not changed in set-2 animals at the L4/young adult time point, many\nof these genes did increase upon R24 treatment. Taken together, this suggests set-2 may impact\nLow SAM alters stress-induced gene expression\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007812\nNovember 28, 2018\n19 / 26\n",

However, the set-16 RNAi animals were particularly sensitive to R24. Interestingly, set-\n16 animals were more deficient in activating pathogen response than CYP in response to R24\nsuggesting that pathogen response genes may be essential for survival. Like sams-1 and set-2\nRNAi, heat stress of set-16(RNAi) animals produced similar activation to control in the top 20\ngenes, in addition to ectopic activation or derepression of many other genes. However, this did\nnot enhance survival. Taken together, this suggests that set-16 has a distinct role in survival\nduring diverse stress responses.\nDuring a stress response, many genes must be coordinately regulated downstream of specific\nsignaling pathways. For example, pathogenic stress may be sensed by activation of Toll-like\nreceptors in mammals and Drosophila [37] or by translational attenuation in C. elegans [38].\nThese signals are carried through stress-specific transcription factors that activate protective\ngenes. Along with these direct regulatory pathways, the chromatin environment must be per-\nmissive. It is intriguing that a metabolic pathway producing the methyl donor SAM and the\nH3K4 methyltransferases set-2 and set-16 are critical to enable transcriptional responses to\nacute stress. This suggests that 1CC status could influence how cells or organisms could respond\nto outside insults. The Halsted lab, using a micropig model of alcoholic fatty liver disease, has\nfound that dietary limitation of methyl donors markedly decreases the time for development of\nliver injury [39, 40], thus, we suggest that low SAM could exacerbate disease progressing by lim-\niting the ability of a tissue to respond to additional stress. This could increase the severity or the\nprogression of a disease by limiting cellular defensive responses. Finally, other metabolites such\nas Acetyl CoA and NAD+ also influence gene regulation [3]. By having multiple metabolic\npathways influencing histone modification and gene regulation, cells might finely tune tran-\nscription to diverse nutritional signals providing templates for specific metabolic states.\nMaterials and methods\nC. elegans culture, RNAi and stress applications\nC. elegans (N2) were cultured using standard laboratory conditions on E. coli OP50. Adults\nwere bleached onto RNAi plates for control (L4440), sams-1, set-2 or set-16 and allowed to\ndevelop to the L4 to young adult transition before stresses were applied. For bacterial stress\nRNA preparations, nematodes were placed on E. coli or P. aeruginosa plates for 6 hours. For\nxenotoxic stress applications animals were placed on DMSO or 70 uM R24 plates for 18 hours.\nFor heat stress applications, animals were raised at 15\u02daC from hatching then at the L4/young\nadult transition replicate plates were placed at 15\u02daC or 37\u02daC for 1 hour. After each stress, ani-\nmals were washed off the plates with S-basal, then pellets frozen at -80\u02daC. RNA was prepared\nas in Ding, et al. 2015 [8]. For survival assays, animals remained on plates until all nematodes\nwere dead. Exposure to Pseudomonas or R24 continued for the life of the animals. Exposure to\nheat occurred for 120 minutes, then animals were kept at 20\u02daC for the remainder of the assay.\nDead animals were identified by gentle prodding and removed each day. Kaplan-Meir curves\nwere generated with OASIS [41].\nAntibodies and immunofluorescence\nImmunofluorescence was performed as in Ding et al. for H3K4me3 staining. For mono or di\nmethyl staining, animals were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in cold 100%\nLow SAM alters stress-induced gene expression\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007812\nNovember 28, 2018\n20 / 26\n",

Duplicate samples were sent for\nlibrary construction and sequencing at BGI (China). Raw sequencing reads were processed\nusing an in-house RNA-Seq data processing software Dolphin at University of Massachusetts\nMedical School. The raw read pairs first were aligned to C. elegans reference genome with\nws245 annotation.

The\nontogeny category tool (Worm-Cat) consists of three parts. First, over 16,000 C. elegans genes\nwere annotated; first by physiological role, then by molecular function. Categories contain up\nto three levels, for example, Proteolysis Proteasome: E3: F-box could appear as Proteolysis Pro-\nteasome in the broad Category 1 or as Proteolysis Proteasome: E3 or Proteolysis Proteasome:\nE3: F-box in the more specific categories 2 and 3. Genes with broad physiological functions\n(e.g., ama-1, RNA polymerase II large subunit) were retained in molecular function categories.\nPhenotype data from alleles or RNAi were used to annotate physiological role if corroborated\nin two or more different assays. In addition, genes with no other function whose expression\nwas changed by at least two of these stresses (Methylmercury, tunicamycin, rotenone, cad-\nmium, ethanol, D-glucose) were placed in the category: Stress response: regulated by multiple\nstresses. Annotations were applied to genes regulated in each condition, then statistical signifi-\ncance of category enrichment determined by Fisher\u2019s exact test with a p-value of < 0.05 used\nto determine significance.\nSupporting information\nS1 Fig. Distinct patterns of gene downregulation in sams-1(RNAi) animals during stress.\nVenn diagrams comparing stress responsive gene expression in control (A), sams-1 (B), set-2\n(C), and set-16 RNAi downregulated genes (D).

Satterlee1, Amy K. Walker1,4, Z.-Y. Jim Sun3, Jennifer L. Watts5,\nRosalie DeBeaumont1,2, R. Mako Saito1,4\u2020, Sven G.

Na\n\u00a8a\n\u00a8r1,2\nThe sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) family of\ntranscription activators are critical regulators of cholesterol and\nfatty acid homeostasis1,2. We previously demonstrated that human\nSREBPs bind the CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300 acetyltrans-\nferase KIX domain and recruit activator-recruited co-factor\n(ARC)/Mediator co-activator complexes through unknown mech-\nanisms3\u20135. Here we show that SREBPs use the evolutionarily\nconserved ARC105 (also called MED15) subunit to activate target\ngenes. Structural analysis of the SREBP-binding domain in\nARC105 by NMR revealed a three-helix bundle with marked\nsimilarity to the CBP/p300 KIX domain. In contrast to SREBPs,\nthe CREB and c-Myb activators do not bind the ARC105 KIX\ndomain, although they interact with the CBP KIX domain,\nrevealing a surprising speci\ufb01city among structurally related\nactivator-binding domains. The Caenorhabditis elegans SREBP\nhomologue SBP-1 promotes fatty acid homeostasis by regulating\nthe expression of lipogenic enzymes6,7. We found that, like SBP-1,\nthe C. elegans ARC105 homologue MDT-15 is required for fatty\nacid homeostasis, and show that both SBP-1 and MDT-15 control\ntranscription of genes governing desaturation of stearic acid to\noleic acid. Notably, dietary addition of oleic acid signi\ufb01cantly\nrescued various defects of nematodes targeted with RNA inter-\nference against sbp-1 and mdt-15, including impaired intestinal fat\nstorage, infertility, decreased size and slow locomotion, suggesting\nthat regulation of oleic acid levels represents a physiologically\ncritical function of SBP-1 and MDT-15. Taken together, our\n\ufb01ndings demonstrate that ARC105 is a key effector of SREBP-\ndependent gene regulation and control of lipid homeostasis in\nmetazoans.\nCholesterol and fatty acids have important functional roles in\nmetazoans, such as modulating membrane \ufb02uidity, serving as signal-\nling molecules and providing energy storage in the form of triacyl-\nglycerides. Abnormal cholesterol and fat levels have been linked to\nprevalent diseases, including atherosclerosis, obesity, type 2 diabetes\nand hypertension (all associated with metabolic syndrome), under-\nscoring the importance of understanding fully how cholesterol and\nlipid homeostasis are regulated and maintained8\u201310.\nThe mammalian SREBP family of basic helix\u2013loop\u2013helix zipper\n(bHLH-Zip) transcription factors promote adipocyte differentiation\nand are critical regulators of cholesterol and fatty acid homeostasis\nby controlling the expression of cholesterogenic and lipogenic\ngenes1,2. Human SREBPs can activate target genes by recruiting the\nchromatin-targeting CBP/p300 acetyltransferases and the polymerase-\nII-interacting ARC/Mediator co-activators3\u20135,11. A short sequence\nwithin the amino-terminal activation domain of SREBP-1a bound\nboth CBP/p300 and the ARC/Mediator co-activator (Fig. 1a, e). We\npreviously identi\ufb01ed the KIX domain in CBP/p300 as a functionally\nimportant target of the SREBP activation domain3 (Fig. 1b). Bioin-\nformatics analysis revealed that the ARC105 subunit of the ARC/\nMediator co-activator contains a region with signi\ufb01cant sequence\nsimilarity to the CBP/p300 KIX domain12, raising the possibility that\nstructurally related motifs present in both CBP/p300 and the ARC/\nMediator co-activator might mediate interaction with SREBP-1a\n(Fig. 1b; see also Supplementary Fig. S1). Indeed, ARC105 bound\nto the SREBP-1a activation domain, but not to a number of other\nactivators13,14 (Fig. 1c, e and data not shown). The SREBP-1a\nactivation domain did not bind signi\ufb01cantly to other ARC/Mediator\nsubunits tested (Fig. 1c and data not shown). The activation domains\nof the SREBP-1c and -2 isoforms also interacted with the ARC/\nMediator co-activator and ARC105, albeit more weakly than\nSREBP-1a (Fig. 1e). SREBP-1a associated with ARC105 in vivo, as\nrevealed by co-immunoprecipitation studies (Fig. 1d). Together,\nthese results show that ARC105 is a direct target of the SREBP family\nof activators.\nThe N-terminal region of ARC105 containing the predicted KIX\ndomain strongly interacted with recombinant SREBP-1a (Fig. 2c),\nsupporting the hypothesis that SREBPs associate with distinct co-\nactivators that harbour related KIX domains. Fluorescence polariz-\nation analysis also showed that the SREBP-1a activation domain\ninteracts with high af\ufb01nity (dissociation constant (Kd) of ,120 nM)\nwith the putative ARC105 KIX domain (Supplementary Fig. S2).\nStructural studies with NMR clearly demonstrated that the ARC105\nSREBP-binding domain folds into a three-helix bundle with striking\nsimilarity to the CBP KIX domain (Fig. 2a, b). Deletion analysis and\npoint mutagenesis provided evidence that the third a-helix of the\nARC105 KIX domain contains the primary SREBP-1a-binding site\n(Fig. 2c, e, f and data not shown).\nThe CBP KIX domain mediates interactions with a number of\nactivators, including the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA)-regulated\nCREB and the c-Myb transactivators15,16.

Thus, the ARC105 KIX domain\ninteracts with only a subset of CBP/p300 KIX-binding activators.\nTyr 658 and Lys 662 in the CBP KIX domain have been implicated in\nthe interaction with PKA-phosphorylated CREB and c-Myb acti-\nvation domains17\u201320; however, these amino acids are not conserved in\nthe ARC105 KIX domain, potentially explaining why CREB and the\nc-Myb activation domain did not bind the ARC105 KIX domain\n(Fig. 2e, f). To address this possibility, Ile 64 and Asp 68 in the\nARC105 KIX domain were changed into the corresponding CBP\namino acids (I64Y/D68K). The doubly mutated ARC105 KIX\ndomain interacted with both CREB and the activation domain of\nc-Myb fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Gal4-MybAD),\nalbeit more weakly than with the CBP KIX domain (Fig. 2d, e).\nThese results suggest that several amino acids located primarily in the\nthird a-helix of the CBP and ARC105 KIX domains provide activator-\nbinding speci\ufb01city. Notably, chemical shift analysis revealed that\nseveral amino acid resonances in the third helix were perturbed upon\nbinding unlabelled SREBP, indicating that this area of the ARC105\nKIX domain is the key SREBP docking site (Fig. 2e, f). The SREBP-1a\nbinding site on the ARC105 KIX domain appears to be distinct from\nthe surfaces on CBP KIX that are bound by CREB (pKID), c-Myb and\nin particular, MLL (Fig. 2f)17\u201322. Together with the lack of conserva-\ntion of Tyr 658 and Lys 662 in the ARC105 KIX domain, these\ndifferences may account for why CREB (pKID) and c-Myb are unable\nto bind effectively to the ARC105 KIX domain (Fig. 2f).\nConsistent with the \ufb01ndings suggesting that the third a-helix of\nthe ARC105 KIX domain constitutes the primary SREBP-binding\nsite, addition of a peptide containing the third a-helix strongly\ninhibited interaction of the SREBP-1a activation domain with both\nthe ARC/Mediator co-activator and CBP/p300 (Fig. 3a). Moreover,\nthe ARC105 peptide acted as a potent inhibitor of ARC/Mediator-\ndependent transactivation by SREBP-1a and Sp1 in a chromatin-\nbased in vitro transcription reaction, while having no effect on\ntransactivation by Sp1 alone (Fig. 3b; see also Supplementary\nFig. S3). Together, these results show that ARC105 harbours a\nfunctionally important SREBP-binding domain that is structurally\nhighly similar to the activator-targeted KIX domain found in the\nCBP/p300 acetyltransferases.\nRNA interference (RNAi) was used to investigate the functional\nrole of ARC105 in SREBP-dependent gene activation in human cells.\nDepletion of ARC105 by short interfering RNA (siRNA) strongly\ndecreased cholesterol-regulated transcription of SREBP target genes,\nincluding low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), fatty acid\nsynthase (FASN), HMG-CoA synthase (HMG-CoAS) and HMG-\nCoA reductase (HMG-CoAR)1,2 (Fig. 3c), as well as activation of a\nFASN promoter reporter by co-transfected SREBP-1a (Fig. 3d). In\ncontrast, RNAi of ARC105 did not affect gene activation by several\nother ARC/Mediator-targeting activators, including BMP-regulated\nSMAD1 (ref. 13), the viral activator VP16 (ref. 14) and the tumour\nsuppressor p53 (data not shown), indicating that depletion of\nARC105 does not globally impinge on the structure or function of\nthe ARC/Mediator co-activator. Consistent with the lack of binding\nof c-Myb to ARC105, knockdown of ARC105 had no effect on\ntransactivation by the activation domain of c-Myb (Fig. 3d). Next,\nwe demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) that\nepitope-tagged SREBP-1a and ARC105 co-expressed in U2OS cells\nco-occupy the LDLR and FASN promoters (Fig. 3e). Moreover, both\nCBP and the ARC/Mediator co-activator were found to be recruited\nto the endogenous LDLR and HMG-CoAR promoters in an SREBP-\n1a-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. S4). These studies show\nthat ARC105 co-localizes with SREBP on target genes and is speci\ufb01-\ncally required for cholesterol-regulated and SREBP-1a-dependent\ngene activation in human cells.\nThe ARC/Mediator co-activator is conserved in the nematode\nC. elegans23, and exploiting the genetic tractability of C. elegans, we\nhave investigated the in vivo role of the ARC105 homologue MDT-15\nin gene activation by the SREBP homologue SBP-1 and in the control\nof lipid homeostasis6,7,24. The activation domain of SBP-1 stimulated\ntranscription in human cells and interacted with the conserved KIX\ndomains of both MDT-15 and human ARC105, suggesting that the\nregulatory circuitry observed in human cells may be conserved in\nC. elegans (Fig. 4a; see also Supplementary Fig. S5). RNAi of either\nmdt-15 or sbp-1 produced a transparent or \u2018clear\u2019 phenotype,\nresembling starved C. elegans deprived of nutrients7,25 (Fig. 4f).\nThis phenotype has been suggested to possibly correlate with\ndecreased fat storage in the intestinal compartment7. By contrast,\nRNAi depletion of many other ARC/Mediator subunits did not yield\na clear intestinal phenotype, indicating that mdt-15 may serve a\nspeci\ufb01c role in maintaining lipid homeostasis and promoting fat\nstorage (Fig. 4f; see also Supplementary Table 2).\nFigure 1 | The activation domains of SREBPs interact with the ARC105\nsubunit of the ARC/Mediator co-activator. a, The ARC/Mediator\nco-activator from HeLa cell nuclear extract (NE) bound to GST fusions of\nthe activation domains of human SREBP-1a (BP1a) and VP16, but not to\nhuman c-Myb.

        "raw_content": "\u00a9 2006 Nature Publishing Group \nGas chromatography/mass spectrometry and thin liquid chroma-\ntography were used to gain a more detailed understanding of the\nalterations in lipid homeostasis upon removal of mdt-15 and sbp-1.\nRNAi of either mdt-15 or sbp-1 resulted in decreased levels of\ntriacylglycerides, the main form of fat stored in the intestinal\ncompartment (triacylglycerides as percentage of total lipids: mdt-\n15(RNAi) 32%, sbp-1(RNAi) 23%, mdt-4(RNAi) 43%, tbg-1(RNAi)\n47%, empty vector 44%). Moreover, RNAi of mdt-15 or sbp-1\nbrought about similar qualitative changes in the ratios of many\ndifferent fatty acids, whereas control RNAi had little effect (Fig. 4b;\nsee also Supplementary Fig. S6a).\nThe saturated fatty acid stearic acid (C18:0) was markedly\nincreased in response to both sbp-1 and mdt-15 RNAi, whereas the\nmonounsaturated fatty acid oleic acid was strongly decreased\n(Fig. 4b). In mammals, SREBPs directly activate transcription of a\nfamily of stearoyl-CoA desaturase genes that act in part to desaturate\nstearic acid to generate oleic acid26. As RNAi of sbp-1 and mdt-15\nproduced a marked increase in the stearic acid to oleic acid ratio\n(from ,2:1 for vector control to ,7:1 for sbp-1(RNAi) and ,16:1 for\nmdt-15(RNAi)), we investigated whether regulation of the fat-6 and\nfat-7 genes, homologues of the mammalian stearoyl-CoA desa-\nturases27, was affected (Supplementary Fig. S6b). Indeed, expression\nof both fat-6 and fat-7 was markedly decreased upon RNAi of mdt-15\nor sbp-1, whereas depletion of C. elegans mdt-4 (control) had little\neffect, indicating a pivotal and speci\ufb01c role of MDT-15 in the\nexpression of SBP-1-regulated genes governing fatty acid desaturation\n(Fig. 4c). Moreover, intestinal expression of a fat-7::GFP reporter\nconstruct was strongly and speci\ufb01cally reduced upon RNAi of either\nsbp-1 or mdt-15 (Fig. 4d; see also Supplementary Fig. S7).\nRNAi of mdt-15 and sbp-1 resulted in similar overt phenotypes,\nincluding clear intestines, growth defects, infertility, aberrant loco-\nmotion and decreased lifespan25 (Fig. 4e, f; see also Supplementary\nFig. S9, and data not shown). Oleic acid serves as a precursor for\nseveral physiologically important pathways, including synthesis of\ntriacylglycerides destined for fat storage, membrane phospholipids,\nand polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)28 (Supplementary Fig. S6b).\nThus, the decreased levels of oleic acid due to impaired expression of\nthe fat-6 and fat-7 stearoyl-CoA desaturases might contribute to\nsome of the phenotypes in mdt-15(RNAi) and sbp-1(RNAi) nema-\ntodes. Notably, RNAi of both fat-6 and fat-7 (fat-6/fat-7(RNAi)\nnematodes) caused phenotypes that were similar to those resulting\nfrom RNAi of mdt-15 and sbp-1, including clear intestines, infertility,\ndecreased motility, smaller size and decreased lifespan25 (Fig. 4f and\ndata not shown). Moreover, dietary supplementation with oleic acid\nimproved the fertility, darkened the intestines, increased locomotion\nand partially rescued the size defect of mdt-15 and sbp-1 RNAi-\ntreated nematodes, and rescued all phenotypes of fat-6/fat-7(RNAi)\nanimals (Fig. 4e, f; see also Supplementary Fig. S9). By contrast,\nstearic acid, which is elevated in response to RNAi of mdt-15 and\nsbp-1, had little effect. These results collectively suggest that oleic\nacid deprivation due to decreased fat-6 and fat-7 desaturase\nexpression is a primary cause of the clear intestines, small size,\ndecreased fecundity and slow locomotion of mdt-15(RNAi) and\nsbp-1(RNAi) nematodes.\nFigure 2 | NMR solution structure of the ARC105 KIX domain.\na, Representation of the 15 lowest energy structures of the ARC105\nSREBP-binding domain reveals a three-helix bundle. b, The human ARC105\nstructure (blue) exhibits marked similarity to the mouse CBP KIX domain\n(red). c, Point mutagenesis revealed that E42, L58 and A60 are important for\nbinding of recombinant Flag-tagged SREBP-1a to the ARC105 KIX domain.\nd, PKA-phosphorylated CREB (P-CREB) and Gal4-MybAD bound to\nimmobilized CBP KIX, but not to the ARC105 KIX domain. Flag-SREBP-1a\ninteracted with both KIX domains. Mutating two amino acids in the\nARC105 KIX domain to the CBP KIX equivalents (I64Y/D68K, double\nmutant or DM) allowed partial binding of both P-CREB and Gal4-MybAD.\ne, Alignment of the human ARC105 and mouse CBP KIX domains reveals\nconservation (bold) in the helical domains (grey). Point mutations in the\nARC105 KIX domain tested for binding to SREBP-1a and other activators\nare indicated by arrows. Amino acids coloured red and blue were strongly\nand moderately affected, respectively, in chemical shift studies upon binding\nof the SREBP-1a activation domain. f, The SREBP-1a binding surface of\nthe ARC105 KIX domain (dark blue/cyan) is distinct from the CBP KIX\nbinding surfaces identi\ufb01ed for the activation domains of CREB (pKID),\nc-Myb and MLL (red). Dark blue amino acids correspond to chemical shift\n.1.0 and cyan amino acids indicate chemical shift of 0.75\u20131.0.\nLETTERS\nNATURE|Vol 442|10 August 2006\n702\n",

Tissue-speci\ufb01c changes in the expression of\nSREBPs, as well as SREBP polymorphisms, have been linked to the\ndevelopment of obesity, atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, fatty liver\nand lipodystrophy in humans and in mice2. As ARC105 is a down-\nstream effector of SREBP gene regulation, altered expression levels or\nmutations/polymorphisms in ARC105 may also contribute to these\ndiseases.\nNote added in proof: A recent paper reported a requirement for mdt-15\nin C. elegans lipid homeostasis29.\nFigure 3 | ARC105 is required for SREBP-dependent transactivation and\nassociates with SREBP target genes in human cells. a, An ARC105 KIX\npeptide (ARC105p) inhibits binding of both CBP/p300 and the\nARC/Mediator co-activator to the GST\u2013SREBP-1a activation domain,\nwhereas a control peptide (Controlp) has no effect. Molecular weights and\nasterisks are as in Fig. 1a. b, ARC105p inhibited ARC/Mediator-dependent\nactivation by SREBP-1a and Sp1 in an in vitro transcription reaction with\nLDLR promoter-derived chromatin template. c, ARC105 knockdown by\nsiRNA in HeLa cells results in decreased cholesterol-regulated expression of\nSREBP target genes, including LDLR, FASN, HMG-CoAS and HMG-CoAR.\nd, ARC105 RNAi inhibited SREBP-1a-dependent transactivation of a\nFASN promoter reporter, without affecting Gal4-MybAD transactivation.\ne, Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of SREBP-1a\u2013HA and\nARC105\u2013Flag on SREBP target genes in U2OS cells. GAPDH was used as\ncontrol. Re-ChIP with anti-HA after anti-Flag immunoprecipitation and\nFlag peptide elution showed that SREBP-1a and ARC105 co-occupy SREBP\ntarget genes. Error bars represent s.e.m.\nFigure 4 | The C. elegans ARC105 homologue MDT-15 is a critical regulator\nof C. elegans SREBP (SBP-1) target genes and is required for normal lipid\nhomeostasis. a, The SBP-1 activation domain interacted with the KIX\ndomains of C. elegans MDT-15 and human ARC105. b, Gas\nchromatography/mass spectrometry analysis revealed altered fatty acid\npro\ufb01les in sbp-1(RNAi) and mdt-15(RNAi) nematodes, as compared with\nempty vector control. c, Transcription of the fat-6 and fat-7 stearoyl-CoA\ndesaturases was strongly decreased upon RNAi of sbp-1 and mdt-15.\nd, Intestinal expression of the fat-7 promoter fused to GFP\n(fat-7Prom::GFP) decreased after RNAi of sbp-1 and mdt-15. e, Dietary\naddition of oleic acid (OA), but not stearic acid (SA), partially rescued\nsterility due to mdt-15 and sbp-1 RNAi, while having no effect on controls\n(tbg-1(RNAi) and mdt-4(RNAi)). f, RNAi of sbp-1, mdt-15 and fat-6 and\nfat-7 yielded pale intestines and smaller animals. Dietary addition of 600 mM\noleic acid, but not stearic acid, darkened the intestines and increased the size\nof mdt-15(RNAi), sbp-1(RNAi) and fat-6/fat-7(RNAi) nematodes.
