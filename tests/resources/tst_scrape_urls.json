About two hours after the rush began, organisers estimated a wait time of about five hours.Keep reading list of 4 itemslist 1 of 4What is Burning Man?

The driving ban has been lifted. Take it slow and mind those directing traffic,\u201d a Burning Man Project statement said.\nAbout 30,000 people remained at the site as of Monday.\nThe event is remote on the best of days and emphasises self-sufficiency. During the flooding, revelers were urged to conserve their food and water, and most remained hunkered down at the site.\n\u201cWe are a little bit dirty and muddy, but spirits are high. The party\u2019s still going,\u201d said Scott London, a Southern California photographer.\nThe annual gathering, which launched on a San Francisco beach in 1986, attracts nearly 80,000 artists, musicians and activists for a mix of wilderness camping and avant-garde performances.\nThe event traditionally culminates with the burning of a large wooden effigy shaped like a man and a wood temple structure during the final two nights. But the fires were postponed as authorities worked to reopen exit routes by the end of the Labor Day weekend.\nA rainbow after rare rain turned the annual Burning Man festival site in Nevada\u2019s desert into a mud pit [Josh Lease/UGC via AFP]\nMostly clear and dry\n\u201cThe Man\u201d was torched on Monday night while, weather permitting, the temple will go up in flames on Tuesday evening.\nThe National Weather Service in Reno, Nevada, said it should stay mostly clear and dry at the festival site although some light rain could pass through on Tuesday morning.\nDisruptions are part of the event\u2019s recent history: Dust storms forced organisers to temporarily close entrances to the festival in 2018, and the event was twice canceled altogether during the pandemic.\nOrganizers also asked attendees not to walk out of the Black Rock Desert \u2013 about 110 miles (177km) north of Reno \u2013 as others had done throughout the weekend, including celebrity DJ Diplo and comedian Chris Rock.\nThe festival had been closed to vehicles after more than a half-inch (1.3cm) of rain fell on Friday, causing flooding and deep mud.\nThe road closures came just before the first of the two ceremonial fires signaling an end to the festival was scheduled to begin on Saturday night.\nAt least one fatality has been reported, but organizers said the death of a man in his 40s was not weather-related. The sheriff of nearby Pershing County said he was investigating.\n \n \n\u00a0\nSource: Al Jazeera and news agenciesaj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss\u00a9 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\n"

Following an announcement at 2 p.m. on Sept. 4 that festivalgoers could leave, vehicles took six or more hours to make the trek out of the drying mud in a backup stretching for miles. The area in Nevada's Black Rock Desert received two months' worth of rain in two days starting on Sept. 1, which resulted in over 70,000 festivalgoers stranded and attempting to flee Black Rock City, a temporary community set up for the festival.\u201cDo not move. You\u2019re going to get stuck,\u201d hosts on Burning Man Information Radio, broadcasting from within the event, told festivalgoers early on Sept. 4.According to NBC News, the Pershing County Sheriff's Office in Lovelock, Nevada, confirmed that one person has died. He was identified on Sept. 4 as Leon Reece, 32, who was declared dead at the scene once first responders arrived, the sheriff's office told NBC News. His cause and manner of death have not been determined. Sgt. Nathan Carmichael of the Pershing County Sheriff\u2019s Office said a toxicology report will need to be completed, but there were no obvious signs of trauma. \u201cNo indication it\u2019s the weather,\u201d he said. \u201cHe had no stab wounds or bullet wounds.\u201dAmid photos of ankle-deep mud, news of a shelter-in-place mandate and the casualty, Marian Goodell, CEO of Burning Man, told NBC News that the situation was under control and that \"there is no cause for panic.\" President Biden was notified of the situation and, according to a spokesperson, administration officials monitored and received updates on the latest details.Why are people stranded at Burning Man?Each year participants in the Burning Man event gather for nine days in an \"annual experiment in temporary community dedicated to Radical Self-expression and Radical Self-reliance,\" according to burningman.org. Held in Nevada since 1991, the festival sees dreamers, artists, tech founders and celebrities \u2014 among others \u2014 converge to create a temporary community in the desert. This year's Burning Man began on Aug. 28 and was slated to run through Sept. 5, with tickets starting at $575 a person.However, shortly after the festival began this year, the area was flooded by torrential rainfall, turning the desert basin \u2014 or playa \u2014 into a muddy, sodden mess, one cars were unable to cross. The \"playa\" refers to the desert streets surrounding Black Rock City's streets, according to a Burning Man blog.By Sept. 1, organizers tweeted on X that the more than 70,000 attendees of Burning Man should \"help each other stay safe\" and that the gate and airport in and out of the area was closed due to the impossibility for vehicles to \"traverse the playa.\" After another day of significant rainfall, the situation became more dire and another tweet issued on Sept. 2 announced that \"Ingress and egress are halted until further notice,\" and asked attendees to conserve food, water and fuel, along with sheltering in a \"warm, safe space.\" An update on BurningMan.org posted the night of Sept. 3 offered those still on site a \"Wet Playa Survival Guide\" with tips, as well as an update saying that conditions were \"improving\" and that roads in Black Rock City were expected to open on Sept. 4 for \"Exodus.\"\"Thank goodness this community knows how to take care of each other,\" the Instagram page for Burning Man Information Radio wrote on a post predicting more rain.Neal Katyal, Chris Rock and others detail their \u2018escape\u2019 from Black Rock CityComedian Chris Rock and Diplo, producer and DJ,\u00a0were among this year's Burning Man attendees. The pair journeyed six miles through the desert on Sept. 2 to escape the difficult conditions and mud, which some likened to quicksand.\"My camp had some celebrities nearby, so we ventured out with Josh Kushner, Karlie Kloss and Cindy Crawford and Chris Rock and some writers, and we just we decided to all go together,\" Diplo told NBC News correspondent Liz Kreutz on TODAY on Sept. 5. \"It felt like we had a little victory, a little battle that day, and it felt nice.\" In an Instagram post, Diplo shared a video of their trek through the mud, citing that he and Rock hitched a ride out of Black Rock City with a fan to return to Reno, 100 miles away.\"A fan offered Chris Rock and I a ride out of burning man in the back of a pick up,\" Diplo wrote in a text overlay of the video.According to Diplo, he and Rock \"walked the side of the road for hours\" because Diplo didn't want to miss a show he was performing at in Washington, D.C. \"The Killing\" actor Joel Kinnaman and fianc\u00e9e Kelly Gale were also at the event.On Sept. 3, Gale posted a photo of her, Kinnaman and others in the mud, writing,  \"Right before our camp/friends split up. Half of us stayed and half of us left. Felt so difficult leaving but the good thing was making sure there would be enough food and water for those who stayed. Praying for everyone to stay safe and get out safe.\"@kellygale via InstagramNeal Katyal, former U.S. acting solicitor general under the Obama administration and Supreme Court lawyer, described his Burning Man experience, writing, \"It was an incredibly harrowing 6 mile hike at midnight through heavy and slippery mud, but I got safely out of Burning Man.\"Despite his treacherous escape, Katyal says he's never been before and that the experience was \"fantastic\" with the exception of \"the ending.\" One death reported amid the floodingAccording to a statement released by the Pershing County Sheriff's Office on Sept. 2, officials were investigating \"a death which occurred during this rain event\" and that \"the family has been notified.\"The death isn't the first at Burning Man. In 2017, a 41-year-old man died after leaping into a 40-foot bonfire known as the \"Man burn\" event, according to NBC News. In 2014, a 29-year-old woman was hit by a bus outside of Black Rock City, and a motorcycle accident claimed the life of a friend of the Burning Man founders back in 1996, according to an article in the Reno Gazette Journal.No, there isn't an outbreak of Ebola at Burning ManThough the death at this year's Burning Man is still being investigated, a social media hoax was blamed for spreading rumors that it's due to a breakout of Ebola. Outside of a rare U.S. outbreak of the disease in 2014, the virus is found primarily in Africa and is often deadly.Posted as a fake CDC warning Sept. 2 on X, the unsubstantiated claim stirred up concern that the thousands who were stranded at Burning Man due to the hazardous road conditions were facing an alarming new concern: Ebola.However, the CDC didn't post the warning and the claims were false. Though Ebola isn't a concern at Burning Man, festivalgoers' health was still at risk. Maya Alexandri, a resident physical and medical volunteer at the festival, told NBC News that the real risk was that those remaining may not have had enough warm clothes and could've suffered ill effects from the ongoing rain and cold. \"These are very, very extreme and devastating conditions under the best circumstances,\" Alexandri told NBC News.
