Another principle of Burning Man, he said, centers on the unconditional giving of gifts with no expectation of receiving one.After sunset Friday, Fromson set off barefoot through the muck for a long trek back to his vehicle\n', 'Source: https://www.vox.com/culture/2023/9/6/23861675/burning-man-2023-mud-stranded-climate-change-playa-foot\nTitle: \nContent: This year’s rains opened the floodgates for Burning Man criticism\n\nSource: https://www.npr.org/2023/09/07/1198054587/burning-man-climate-change-activists\nTitle: \nContent: Culture \nBurning Man festival organizers lift driving ban and allow people to leave\nFor now, Donnelly said the Black Rock Playa — the dry lake bed where Burning Man takes place every year — "is going to be just fine."  The recent flooding will actually bring to life a vibrant ecosystem of invertebrates that live as desiccated eggs under the surface of the desert, waiting to become hydrated so they can hatch.  It\'s the Burning Man organizers who are still on site that he said will have to deal with the accumulating effects of the extreme weather over the landscape. Part of their permit from the state stipulates that they leave no trace of their activities on the land.  "It\'s not just the trash they have to pick up, but they also have to recontour the playa. They basically need to smooth out all of those tracks," Donnelly explained.  "They\'ve got a good track record but they\'ve got a huge amount of work ahead of them," he added.  It will likely continue to get harder. \nclimate change\n\nSource: https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjvzw5/burning-man-has-fallen-attendees-warned-not-to-arrive-due-to-flooding-from-storms\nTitle: \nContent: Burning Man Has Fallen: Attendees Warned Not to Arrive Due to Flooding From Storms Sign InCreate Account+ EnglishVICEVideoTVCultureNewsTechMunchiesRec RoomDrugsEntertainmentEnvironmentExtremismHoroscopesIdentityInvestigationsJusticeMoneyMusicPhotographySexTravelVICE MagazineVICE VoicesThe Unfiltered History TourThe Gender Spectrum CollectionVICESign InCreate AccountVideoTVAppsPodcastsNewslettersInput for searching articles, videos, showsCultureNewsTechMunchiesRec RoomDrugsEntertainmentEnvironmentExtremismHoroscopesIdentityInvestigationsJusticeMoneyMusicPhotographySexTravelVICE MagazineVICE VoicesThe Unfiltered History TourThe Gender Spectrum CollectionAbout JobsPartnerVICE VoicesContent Funding on VICESecurity PolicyPrivacy & TermsAccessibility Statement© 2024 VICE MEDIA GROUPBurning Man Has Fallen: Attendees Warned Not to Arrive Due to Flooding From StormsThe gates to the annual gathering attended by wealthy CEOs and celebrities remain closed this week due to storms battering the U.S.\n\nSource: https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjvzw5/burning-man-has-fallen-attendees-warned-not-to-arrive-due-to-flooding-from-storms\nTitle: \nContent: We will post additional updates here."Are you a Burning Man attendee or Gerlach resident who is dealing with the effects of storms on the gathering this year? We want to hear from you: Email jordan.pearson@vice.com.Experts say that Hilary\'s fierce impact is due to a combination of factors, one of which is human-caused climate change due to the consumption of fossil fuels. On this point, Burning Man has a notorious track record. Attendees typically arrive by car, SUV, RV, or plane, and then set up generators in the desert, all of which burn tons of fuel and create pollution. This reality has been cause for some reflection among attendees as rising temperatures have plagued the gathering.\xa0This year, Burning Man organizers sued the U.S. government to block a geothermal project that aims to produce renewable energy near the site of the gathering. The plan is part of the Biden Administration\'s effort to get the U.S. power grid running on renewable sources of energy by 2035.

This isn’t the first time the festival has had bad weather; in 2014, rain and mud delayed the event opening, and even at the best of times, “playa dust” creates terrible air quality for attendees. “Burning Man will get dirtier before it gets cleaner — and will miss its own goal of being net negative on emissions by 2030 — unless the Org makes big changes,” Wired reported last year regarding Burning Man’s sustainability efforts. Meanwhile, climate change continues to endanger outdoor festivals due to the increasing risk of heat exposure; for a festival that banks on the radical allure of roughing it in the desert heat, that large wooden Man won’t be the only one burning.\nWill you support Vox today?\n\nSource: https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjvzw5/burning-man-has-fallen-attendees-warned-not-to-arrive-due-to-flooding-from-storms\nTitle: \nContent: effort to get the U.S. power grid running on renewable sources of energy by 2035.

(AP) — Wait times for tens of thousands of Burning Man partygoers trying to exit the mud-caked northern Nevada desert are beginning to decrease after flooded roads left them stranded there for days.Event organizers said they started to let traffic flow out on the main road around 2 p.m. local time Monday — even as they urged attendees to delay their exit to help ease traffic. About two hours after the mass departure began, organizers estimated a wait time of about five hours.By Tuesday morning, wait times had dropped to between two and three hours, according to the official Burning Man account on the social network X, formerly known as Twitter.The annual gathering, which launched on a San Francisco beach in 1986, attracts nearly 80,000 artists, musicians and activists for a week-long mix of wilderness camping and avant-garde performances.\n\nSource: https://apnews.com/article/burning-man-flooding-nevada-stranded-0726190c9f8378935e2a3cce7f154785\nTitle: \nContent: The festival had been closed to vehicles after more than a half-inch (1.3 centimeters) of rain fell Friday, causing flooding and foot-deep mud.The road closures came just before the first of two ceremonial fires signaling an end to the festival was scheduled to begin Saturday night. The event traditionally culminates with the burning of a large wooden effigy shaped like a man and a wood temple structure during the final two nights, but the fires were postponed as authorities worked to reopen exit routes by the end of the Labor Day weekend.\n                    READ MORE\n                \nStorms damage homes in Oklahoma and Kansas.
