(AP) \u2014 The traffic jam leaving the Burning Man festival eased up considerably Tuesday as the exodus from the mud-caked Nevada desert entered another day following massive rain that left tens of thousands of partygoers\u00a0stranded for days.A pair of brothers from Arizona who took their 67-year-old mother with them to Burning Man for the first time spent 11 hours into early Tuesday morning just getting out of the festival site about 110 miles (177 kilometers) north of Reno.\u201cIt was a perfect, typical Burning Man weather until Friday \u2014 then the rain started coming down hard,\u201d said Phillip Martin, 37. \u201cThen it turned into Mud Fest.\u201dEvent organizers began letting traffic flow out on the main road Monday afternoon \u2014 even as they urged attendees to delay their exit to help ease traffic. The wait time to exit Black Rock City was about 3.5 hours as of Tuesday at about 5 p.m., according to the official Burning Man Traffic account on X, formerly known as Twitter.Roughly 36,000 people remained at the site Tuesday by mid-afternoon, organizers said.The annual celebration of free spirits in one of the most remote places in America launched on a San Francisco beach in 1986 and has since grown in size and popularity. Nearly 80,000 artists, musicians and activists visit the Black Rock Desert every year to build a city of colorful themed camps, decorated art cars and guerilla theatrics in preparation for the ceremonial burnings of a towering, faceless effigy and a temple dedicated to the dead.Most attendees travel to the stark desert for a week to express themselves with music and art, commune with nature, or \u201cfind themselves.\u2033 Others visit the ancient lake bottom for a psychedelic party full of hallucinogens and nudity before the burning of the wooden effigy.The event this year began Aug. 27 and was scheduled to end Monday morning, with attendees breaking down camps and cleaning up \u2014 until the rains came.After more than a half-inch (1.3 centimeters) of rain fell Friday, flooding turned the playa to foot-deep mud \u2014 closing roads and forcing burners to lean on each other for help.Burning Man emphasizes self-sufficiency, and many burners arrive in Black Rock Desert with limited supplies, expecting to face challenges in the form of brutal heat, dust storms \u2014 or torrential rains.Disruptions\u00a0are part of the event\u2019s recent history: Dust storms forced organizers to temporarily close entrances\u00a0to the festival in 2018, and the event was twice canceled altogether during the pandemic.Mark Fromson, 54, who goes by the name \u201cStuffy\u201d on the playa, had been staying in an RV, but the rains forced him to find shelter at another camp, where fellow burners provided him food and cover. Another principle of Burning Man, he said, centers on the unconditional giving of gifts with no expectation of receiving one.After sunset Friday, Fromson set off barefoot through the muck for a long trek back to his vehicle \u2014 the dense playa suddenly a thick clay that clung to his feet and legs. The challenge, he said, was the mark of a \u201cgood burn.\u201d\u201cBest burn yet,\u201d he said. \u201cThe old, crusty burners who have been out there for 40 years would just laugh at us with all the creature comforts we come onto the playa with.\u201dThe road closures came just before the first of the ceremonial fires were scheduled to begin Saturday night. Shortly thereafter, the fires themselves were postponed as authorities worked to reopen exit routes by the end of the Labor Day weekend.\u201cThe Man\u201d was torched Monday night, but the temple was set to burn at 8 p.m. Tuesday. By tradition, revelers leave the names of departed loved ones and other remembrances to be burned in the temple. For many, torching the temple has become the centerpiece of the burning \u2014 a more intimate, spiritual event than the rave-party-like immolation of the effigy.The rain also posed significant challenges for authorities responding to emergency situations \u2014 including the death of a man identified as 32-year-old Leon Reece.Due to the rain, access to the area where Reece was reported unresponsive was delayed, but authorities said it did not appear weather played a role in his death. A cause of death is pending the results of an autopsy, which can take six to eight weeks, according to the Pershing County Sheriff\u2019s Office.Amid the flooding, revelers were urged to conserve their food and water, and most remained hunkered down at the site. Some attendees, however, managed to walk several miles to the nearest town or catch a ride there.Many stuck at Burning Man turned to the official Black Rock City radio station \u2014 BMIR 94.5 FM \u2014 to issue pleas for rides to Reno, San Francisco and other neighboring cities. DJs informed listeners about what the stranded have with them \u2014 crates, bicycles, supplies \u2014 and offers to split fuel and food costs.Alexander Elmendorf braved the harsh weather at a campsite set with trailers, RVs and an aerial rig. He was waiting Tuesday to clean up the debris left behind by the tens of thousands who exited the area.\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a lot of work for everyone involved,\u201d said Elmendorf, 36, who planned to stay until Friday to help with cleanup efforts. \u201cAnd by that, I mean, get everything off the ground.\u201dBy Tuesday afternoon the ground had lost most of its moisture, which at one point you could build a mud-based snowman in, he said. Elmendorf, who has been to Burning Man three other times, said staff had essentially kicked the last burners out each year.\u201cNo one\u2019s rushing anyone out this year,\u201d he said. \u201cI think more so people are rushing themselves off.\u201d___This story corrects Phillip Martin\u2019s age to 37.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

The heavy rainfall fell on dry desert grounds, whipping up thick, clay-like mud that festivalgoers say is too difficult to walk or bike through.\"More rain is expected over the next few days and conditions are not expected to improve enough to allow vehicles to enter the playa,\" the Bureau of Land Management said in a statement obtained by the Reno Gazette Journal.The Pershing County Sheriff's Office said it's investigating \"a death which occurred during this rain event.\" Authorities did not publicly name the person or provide details on the circumstances of the death.\"The family has been notified and the death is under investigation,\" the sheriff's office said in a late Saturday news release.Authorities have not provided information on when roads could reopen, but the sunshine is expected to return Monday after more showers Sunday.\"We do not currently have an estimated time for the roads to be dry enough for RVs or vehicles to navigate safely,\" Burning Man organizers said in a Saturday evening statement. \"Monday late in the day would be possible if weather conditions are in our favor. It could be sooner.\"Organizers did note that the rain falling on an already saturated playa overnight and Sunday \"will affect the amount of time it takes for the playa to dry.\"For now, the gate and airport into Black Rock City remain closed and no driving is allowed into or out of the city except for emergency vehicles, the organizers said on social media. Black Rock City is a temporary metropolis that is erected annually for the festival and comes complete with emergency, safety and sanitary infrastructure.The rain \"made it virtually impossible for motorized vehicles to traverse the playa,\" the Pershing County Sheriff's Office said, noting that people were advised to shelter in place until the ground has dried enough to drive on safely.Vehicles trying to drive out will get stuck in the mud, Burning Man organizers said Saturday. \"It will hamper Exodus if we have cars stuck on roads in our camping areas, or on the Gate Road out of the city,\" the organizers added.\"If you are in BRC, please shelter in place & stay safe,\" organizers said.Difficult conditions, but some stay positiveSome festival-goers hiked miles on foot in the thick mud to reach main roads while others stayed at their camps, hoping for conditions to improve.Hannah Burhorn, a first-time attendee at the festival, told CNN people were trudging through the mud barefoot or with bags tied around their feet.\"People who have tried to bike through it and have gotten stuck because it's about ankle deep,\" Burhorn said. The mud is so thick that it \"sticks to your shoes and makes it almost like a boot around your boot,\" she added.It's unclear exactly how many people are stranded at the festival, but typically more than 70,000 people attend the weeklong event. It's being held from August 28 to September 4 this year.There weren't any reports of injuries as of Saturday afternoon, Sean Burke, the director of emergency management for Pershing County, told CNN.Amar Singh Duggal and his friends managed to leave the festival after hiking about 2 miles in the mud, he told CNN. He estimated it took them about 2 hours to get to a main road where they arranged to be picked up and taken to Reno, about a 120-mile drive from the event grounds.\"We made it, but it was pure hell (walking) through the mud,\" Duggal said. \"Each step felt like we were walking with two big cinderblocks on our feet.\"Meanwhile, attendees who typically dedicate their time to making art and building community are now also focused on rationing supplies and dealing with connectivity issues.\"There is super limited bandwidth and a lot of people at the camp (are) trying to cancel flights and arrange for extended time here\" due to the weather, Burhorn told CNN via text message from a Wi-Fi camp.Still, the poor conditions have not stopped the creativity, said Burhorn, who had traveled from San Francisco.\"People are building mud sculptures,\" she said.Andrew Hyde, another attendee stuck at the Burning Man, said that despite the muddy conditions making it difficult to walk, the weather has taken the meaning of the event back to its roots.\"You come out here to be in a harsh climate, and you prepare for that,\" Hyde told CNN's Paula Newton. \"So in many ways, everybody here just kind of made friends with their neighbors and it's a community event.\"Morale at the event is OK and there's generally no panic among the attendees, Hyde said, describing music returning overnight.There are worries about the additional rain causing delays, however, and the unknowns of worsening conditions.\"I think the concern is if we have another rain,\" he said. \"People need to go back to their jobs, back to the responsibilities they have back home.\"Assistance brought inOrganizers announced Saturday night they'll be putting mobile cell trailers in different positions, configuring the organization's Wi-Fi system for public access and deploying buses to nearby Gerlach to take people who might walk off the playa to Reno.\"This is not likely a 24-hour operation at this time,\" the festival said in a statement on its website.Organizers are also resourcing four-wheel drive vehicles and all-terrain tires to help ferry medical and other urgent situations to the blacktop.There have been people who managed to walk to a main road and were waiting for transport from the festival organizers Saturday night, the Pershing County Sheriff's Office said.Resources have been brought in from around northern Nevada to help people with medical needs on the event grounds, the sheriff's office said.\"Burning Man is a community of people who are prepared to support one another,\" Burning Man said on its website. \"We have come here knowing this is a place where we bring everything we need to survive. It is because of this that we are all well-prepared for a weather event like this.\"\"We have done table-top drills for events like this,\" organizers added. \"We are engaged full-time on all aspects of safety and looking ahead to our Exodus as our next priority.\"The CNN Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Nathan Carmichael, with the Pershing County Sheriff\u2019s Office, told CNN Sunday morning. Some people have left the site by walking out but \u201cmost of the RVs are stuck in place,\u201d he said.\n    \n            On Sunday morning, event organizers said roads remained closed as they were \u201ctoo wet and muddy\u201d and more uncertain weather was likely on the way. While some vehicles were able to leave, others got stuck in the mud, organizers said on the event\u2019s website.\n            \u201cPlease do NOT drive at this time,\u201d they added. \u201cWe will update you on the driving ban after this weather front has left the area.\u201d\n    \n            The remote area in northwest Nevada was hit with 2 to 3 months\u2019 worth of rain \u2013 up to 0.8 inches \u2013 in just 24 hours between Friday and Saturday morning. The heavy rainfall fell on dry desert grounds, whipping up thick, clay-like mud festivalgoers said was too difficult to walk or bike through.\n    \nAmerican DJ Diplo performs during the 2023 Governors Ball Music Festival at Flushing Meadows Corona Park in New York City, on June 9, 2023.\nAngela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images\nDiplo hitchhiked ride out of rain-drenched Burning Man after walking miles 'through the mud' and actually made it to his DC concert\n            A death at the festival that was confirmed by authorities on Saturday was \u201cunrelated to the weather,\u201d Burning Man organizers said Sunday night. \n    \n            Emergency personnel responded to a call for service regarding a 40-year-old man Friday but could not resuscitate him, organizers said, without providing further details.\n    \n            The Pershing County Sheriff\u2019s Office earlier said it is investigating the death. \n    \n            Playa is the term used to describe sunken dry lake beds in deserts where water evaporates rather than running off, and even a small amount of rain can quickly soak a large area.\n    \nA person with a muddy suitcase waits to leave the Burning Man site on Sept. 3, 2023.\nJason Bean/Reno Gazette Journal/USA Today Network\n            The rainy conditions forecast over the area for Sunday afternoon had mostly passed to the east of the festival site, according to a social media post from organizers, though there is still a chance of showers and thunderstorms \u201cfor the rest of daylight hours\u201d into the evening.\n    \n            Event organizers announced earlier Sunday plans to burn the Man \u2013 the huge totem set on fire at the festival\u2019s culmination \u2013 on Sunday night if weather allowed.\n    \n            However, the burn was rescheduled for Monday night \u201cdue to rain and muddy conditions Sunday, and an inability to move heavy equipment and fire safety onsite,\u201d organizers said.\n    \nVideo Ad Feedback\nDrone video shows vehicles stranded and stuck at Burning Man\n                \n                                01:00\n                            \n - Source:\n                CNN\n    How long this could last\n            Authorities have not provided information on when roads could reopen, but the sunshine is expected to return Monday.\n    \nBurning Man attendees walk through the mud on Saturday.\nTrevor Hughes/USA Today Network\n            \u201cWe do not currently have an estimated time for the roads to be dry enough for RVs or vehicles to navigate safely,\u201d Burning Man organizers said in a Saturday evening statement. \u201cMonday late in the day would be possible if weather conditions are in our favor.

An investigation is ongoing, Radke said in a news release.\n    \nDawn brought muddy realization to the Burning Man encampment, where the exit gates remain closed indefinitely because driving is virtually impossible.\nTrevor Hughes/USA Today\n    Difficult conditions, but some stay positive\n            Some festivalgoers hiked miles on foot in the thick mud to reach main roads while others stayed at their camps, hoping for conditions to improve.\n    \n            Hannah Burhorn, a first-time attendee at the festival, told CNN people were trudging through the mud barefoot or with bags tied around their feet.\n    \n            \u201cPeople who have tried to bike through it and have gotten stuck because it\u2019s about ankle deep,\u201d Burhorn said. The mud is so thick it \u201csticks to your shoes and makes it almost like a boot around your boot,\u201d she added.\n    \n            It\u2019s unclear exactly how many people are stranded at the festival, but typically more than 70,000 people attend the weeklong event. It\u2019s being held from August 28 to September 4 this year.\n    \n            There weren\u2019t any reports of injuries as of Saturday afternoon, Sean Burke, the director of emergency management for Pershing County, told CNN.\n    \n            Amar Singh Duggal and his friends managed to leave the festival after hiking about 2 miles in the mud, he told CNN. He estimated it took them about 2 hours to get to a main road where they arranged to be picked up and taken to Reno, about a 120-mile drive from the event grounds.\n    \nHeavy rain covered the ground with thick mud at Burning Man in Black Rock Desert.\nAndrew Hyde\n            \u201cWe made it, but it was pure hell (walking) through the mud,\u201d Duggal said. \u201cEach step felt like we were walking with two big cinder blocks on our feet.\u201d\n    \n            Among those attending the festival was DJ Diplo and comedian Chris Rock.\n            Rock posted a video on Instagram of thick mud and Diplo posted a series of videos in which he said a fan offered him and Rock a ride out of the site.\n    \n            The DJ said they walked several miles and were able to get to a nearby airport.\n    \n            Meanwhile, attendees who typically dedicate their time to making art and building community are now also focused on rationing supplies and dealing with connectivity issues.\n    \n            \u201cThere is super limited bandwidth and a lot of people at the camp (are) trying to cancel flights and arrange for extended time here\u201d due to the weather, Burhorn told CNN via text message from a Wi-Fi camp.\n    \nA still from a drone video shows vehicles trying to leave the Burning Man festival on Sunday, September 3.\nCNN\n            Still, the poor conditions have not stopped the creativity, said Burhorn, who had traveled from San Francisco.\n    \n            \u201cPeople are building mud sculptures,\u201d she said.\n    \n            Andrew Hyde, another attendee stuck at the Burning Man, said despite the muddy conditions making it difficult to walk, the weather has taken the meaning of the event back to its roots.\n    \n            \u201cYou come out here to be in a harsh climate, and you prepare for that,\u201d Hyde told CNN\u2019s Paula Newton. \u201cSo in many ways, everybody here just kind of made friends with their neighbors and it\u2019s a community event.\u201d\n    \n            Morale at the event is OK and there\u2019s generally no panic among the attendees, Hyde said, describing music returning overnight.\n    \n            There are worries about the additional rain causing delays, however, and the unknowns of worsening conditions.\n    \n            \u201cI think the concern is if we have another rain,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople need to go back to their jobs, back to the responsibilities they have back home.\u201d\n    \n    Assistance brought in\nA rainbow appears at Burning Man in Black Rock Desert, Nevada, on September 2, 2023.\nAndrew Hyde\n            Organizers announced Saturday night they\u2019ll be putting mobile cell trailers in different positions, configuring the organization\u2019s Wi-Fi system for public access and deploying buses to nearby Gerlach to take people who might walk off the playa to Reno.\n    \n            \u201cThis is not likely a 24-hour operation at this time,\u201d the festival said in a statement on its website.\n    \n            Organizers are also resourcing four-wheel-drive vehicles and all-terrain tires to help ferry medical and other urgent situations to the blacktop.\n    \n            There have been people who managed to walk to a main road and were waiting for transport from the festival organizers Saturday night, the Pershing County Sheriff\u2019s Office said.\n    \n            Resources have been brought in from around northern Nevada to help people with medical needs on the event grounds, the sheriff\u2019s office said.\n    \n            \u201cBurning Man is a community of people who are prepared to support one another,\u201d Burning Man said on its website. \u201cWe have come here knowing this is a place where we bring everything we need to survive. It is because of this that we are all well-prepared for a weather event like this.\u201d\n    \n            \u201cWe have done table-top drills for events like this,\u201d organizers added. \u201cWe are engaged full-time on all aspects of safety and looking ahead to our Exodus as our next priority.\u201d\n    \n  CNN\u2019s Gene Norman, Paradise Afshar, Sharif Paget, Christal Hayes, Michelle Watson, Angela Fritz and Ashley R.
